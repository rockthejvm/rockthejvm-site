  {question: "How is a typical lesson like?", answer: "Code is king, and we write it from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts, either briefly on a diagram or directly in the code. We then run live examples, and usually I'll finish the lesson with some exercises, which I then solve on camera after you've tried them yourself."},
  {question: "Does this work in real life?", answer: "It works. That's not for me to say, that's the 80000 people taking this material and applying it in real life. I teach the same material at Apple, Adobe and some of the best companies in the world."},
  {question: "Dude, this seems massive. How do I approach it?", answer: "Yes, it's massive, but it doesn't have to be intimidating. This is a buffet, you don't need to eat everything. Take Scala first. You'll probably like it, so much that I bet after 2 weeks this question won't be relevant anymore."},
  {question: "What if I don't like it?", answer: "Just cancel your subscription, and you'll be on your way. You will have access to everything until the next payment is due. The payments already made are not refundable, though. You'll still be a member of the Slack community - unless you want to leave us for good, which will make us all sad."},
  {question: "I've never written code before, but this seems interesting. Can I enroll?", answer: "You can, but you probably shouldn't (yet). The courses are for people who have coded before (in some other language), and we assume general programming fundamentals. I'll probably come back with a very (very) slow and easy version for Scala as a first language, which will unlock the skills you need to take everything else."},
  {question: "I already have access to some of the courses. Can I just pay the difference?", answer: "The mechanics for this one is different. When you buy a course, you have access to it for life. When you buy the membership, you have access to everything on the site as long as you're subscribed, including future courses. For that reason, I cannot accommodate a \"pay the difference\" request."},
  {question: "What's not included in the membership?", answer: "The Rites of Passage. Even as the Rock the JVM courses are jam-packed, effective and full of lessons, the Rites of Passage are a completely different kind of experience and they require a different kind of commitment."},

      <h3>Daniel CiocÃ®rlan</h3>
      <p>I'm a software engineer and the founder of Rock the JVM.</p>
      <p>
        I worked on my first production Kotlin server-side application in 2017
        (when Kotlin server-side wasn't cool yet ðŸ˜†), a logistics management
        application for a big plane manufacturer. I've written a lot more code
        since, I learned a ton, and I want to share everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of February 2024, I've taught Kotlin, Scala and other libraries to
        100000+ students at various levels and I've held live training sessions
        for some of the top companies in the industry, including Adobe and
        Apple. I've also taught university students who now work at Google and
        Facebook (among others), I've held Hour of Code for 7-year-olds and I've
        taught more than 35000 kids to code (not in Kotlin, yet ðŸ˜†).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You're in good hands in this course.</strong> I'll guide you every
        step of the way, and our private community at Rock the JVM is full of passionate
        people just like you.
