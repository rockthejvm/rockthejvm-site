      <h3>Daniel CiocÃ®rlan</h3>
      <p>I'm a software engineer and the founder of Rock the JVM.</p>
      <p>
        I worked on my first production Kotlin server-side application in 2017
        (when Kotlin server-side wasn't cool yet ðŸ˜†), a logistics management
        application for a big plane manufacturer. I've written a lot more code
        since, I learned a ton, and I want to share everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of February 2024, I've taught Kotlin, Scala and other libraries to
        100000+ students at various levels and I've held live training sessions
        for some of the top companies in the industry, including Adobe and
        Apple. I've also taught university students who now work at Google and
        Facebook (among others), I've held Hour of Code for 7-year-olds and I've
        taught more than 35000 kids to code (not in Kotlin, yet ðŸ˜†).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You're in good hands in this course.</strong> I'll guide you every
        step of the way, and our private community at Rock the JVM is full of passionate
        people just like you.
