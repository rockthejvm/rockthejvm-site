:::note[TL;DR]
Never call external APIs inside a database transaction. If the external call succeeds but the DB commit fails, you have an inconsistent state you cannot roll back. Use **Transactional Outbox + Result Table + Saga Compensation** to ensure distributed consistency without 3 AM cleanup scripts.

## The 3 AM Wake‑Up Call

It's 3 AM. Your phone won't stop buzzing. PagerDuty.

**"CRITICAL: Order reconciliation job failed - 47 orders missing from database"**

You sit up in bed, already dreading what you're about to find. You open your laptop with that sinking feeling - the one every backend engineer knows too well.

The logs show orders from business hours. Normal traffic. Nothing unusual. Payment API responses? All 200 OK. Shipping confirmations? All sent.

But your database?

**47 orders are missing.**

Customers have been charged. Packages are being shipped to addresses. Confirmation emails cheerfully sent. But your `orders` table? It's like those transactions never happened.

You dig deeper. The pattern becomes clear:

```
14:23:15 INFO  Payment API → 200 OK (order-8473)
14:23:15 INFO  Shipping API → 200 OK (order-8473)
14:23:16 ERROR Database transaction → DEADLOCK
14:23:16 INFO  Retrying transaction... (attempt 2/3)
14:23:17 ERROR Database transaction → ROLLBACK
```

This happens because someone wrote code like this:

```scala
// Looks transactional... but isn't.
db.run {
  (for {
    orderId <- orders += order // DB write
    inventoryRes <- DBIO.from(inventoryApi.reserve(orderId)) // API call ✅
    shippingRes <- DBIO.from(shippingApi.schedule(orderId)) // API call ✅
    billingRes <- DBIO.from(billingApi.charge(orderId)) // API call ✅
    _ <- shipments += Shipment(orderId, shippingRes.id) // DB write - DEADLOCK!
  } yield orderId).transactionally
}
```

What actually happened:

1. ✅ Insert order → succeeds
2. ✅ Call inventory API → 200 OK (inventory reserved)
3. ✅ Call shipping API → 200 OK (shipment scheduled)
4. ✅ Call billing API → 200 OK (customer charged)
5. ❌ Insert shipment record →  **Fails** (network error, deadlock - doesn't matter)
6. 🔄 Transaction rolls back


Result: Money charged, shipment scheduled, inventory reserved... but no order exists in your database.
The external APIs don't know your transaction failed. They already did their work.

## Understanding the Patterns

Before diving into the fix, let's understand **why** we need two patterns working together.

### Problem 1: The Naive Approach (Why It Breaks)

Here's what most developers try first:

```scala
// Step 1: Save to database
val orderId = db.run {
  orders += order
}.transactionally

// Step 2: Call external services
inventoryApi.reserve(orderId)
shippingApi.schedule(orderId)
billingApi.charge(orderId)
```

**Seems reasonable, right? Wrong. Here's what breaks:**

#### Failure Mode 1: App Crashes Between Step 1 and Step 2

```scala
val orderId = db.run {
  orders += order
}.transactionally // ✅ Succeeds
// 💥 App crashes here (out of memory, deployment, server restart)
inventoryApi.reserve(orderId) // ← Never executed
```

**Result:** Order saved in the table, but no inventory reserved, no shipping scheduled.
The order is stuck forever.
No retry will happen because the app lost the `orderId` from memory.

#### Failure Mode 2: First API Succeeds, Second API Fails

```scala
val orderId = db.run {
  orders += order
}.transactionally // ✅ Succeeds
inventoryApi.reserve(orderId) // ✅ Succeeds
shippingApi.schedule(orderId) // ❌ Network timeout after 30 seconds
```

**Result:** Order saved, inventory reserved, but no shipping.
The warehouse has reserved items for an order that will never ship.
And you don't know if you should retry shipping (what if it partially succeeded?).

#### Failure Mode 3: Kafka Publish Fails

```scala
val orderId = db.run {
  orders += order
}.transactionally // ✅ Succeeds
kafka.publish("order-created", orderId) // ❌ Kafka broker down
```

**Result:** Order saved, but the event is lost forever. Downstream services never receive the notification. **No way to recover** - you don't even know the event failed to publish.

**The fundamental problem:** You can't make external systems (HTTP APIs, Kafka, message queues) participate in your database transaction.
They're separate systems with their own failure modes.

---

### The Transactional Outbox Pattern (Making It Reliable)

**The insight:** Instead of calling external systems directly, write a **durable to-do list** in the same transaction.

Think of it like leaving a sticky note on your desk before going to bed:

- ❌ **Naive approach:** "I'll remember to call the API tomorrow" (you won't)
- ✅ **Outbox approach:** "I'll write it down on paper tonight" (it survives even if you forget)

```scala
// Write BOTH the order AND the to-do list atomically
db.run {
  (for {
    orderId <- orders += order
    _ <- outboxEvents += OutboxEvent(
      aggregateId = orderId.toString,
      eventType = "OrderCreated",
      payloads = Map(
        "inventory" ->...,
    "shipping" ->...,
    "billing" ->...
    )
    )
  } yield orderId).transactionally
}

// Later: A background processes the to-do list
```

**What this solves:**

| Failure Scenario            | Without Outbox                    | With Outbox                                      |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| App crashes after DB commit | ❌ Event lost forever (in memory)  | ✅ Event persisted, processed on restart          |
| Kafka broker down           | ❌ Event lost, no retry            | ✅ Event stays in outbox, retried automatically   |
| Network timeout             | ❌ Don't know if request succeeded | ✅ Tracked in result table                        |
| API succeeds, DB rolls back | ❌ **Can happen with DBIO.from()** | ✅ **Impossible** - APIs only called after commit |

**External APIs are only called AFTER the database transaction commits**.
This makes the "API succeeds but DB rolls back" scenario physically impossible.

The outbox table is your **durable to-do list** that survives:

- App crashes
- Deployments
- Server restarts
- Network failures
- Kafka outages

---

### But Wait - the Outbox Doesn't Solve Partial Failures!

---

### Problem 2: Partial Failures

Great, the outbox pattern saved us! Events are durable, apps can crash, everything's fine.

But now imagine your event fans out to 3 services:

```
1. Reserve inventory  ✅ succeeds → reservationId = "RES-456"
2. Schedule shipping  ✅ succeeds → shippingId = "SHIP-789"
3. Charge payment     ❌ fails after 3 retries
```

Uh oh.

You can't just leave it like this. You have:

- Inventory reserved (blocking stock for other customers)
- Shipment scheduled (warehouse will pack and ship... nothing)
- No payment (customer wasn't charged)

**You need to undo steps 1 and 2.**

### The Saga Pattern

A **Saga** is a sequence of transactions where:

- Each transaction is local to one service
- If any transaction fails, **compensating transactions** undo previous steps
- Compensation happens in **reverse order** (LIFO - Last In, First Out)

Think of it like a tower of blocks. You can't remove the bottom block first - you have to dismantle from the top down.
Cancel shipping before releasing inventory, because shipping depends on inventory being reserved.

**Two approaches:**

1. **Choreography**: Each service publishes events, others react (decentralized)
2. **Orchestration**: A central coordinator controls the flow (centralized)

We use **orchestration** because:

- ✅ Easier to debug (all logic in one place)
- ✅ You know exactly what succeeded (for compensation)
- ✅ Conditional routing is straightforward

---

### How They Work Together

| Pattern                  | Solves             | How                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Transactional Outbox** | Dual-write problem | Write order + event to DB atomically           |
| **Saga (Orchestration)** | Partial failures   | Track what succeeded, compensate in LIFO order |

**Together:**

1. **Outbox** ensures the event is never lost (even if app crashes)
2. **Saga** ensures partial failures are compensated (automatically undo)

**How do we know what to compensate?**

→ **The Result Table** tracks every API call:

- Which calls succeeded
- What IDs they returned (needed for revert)
- Complete audit trail

        pg_notify('dlq_events_channel')

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

DLQProcessor (Pekko Actor)

    ├─ SELECT * FROM aggregate_results
    │  WHERE aggregate_id = 'ORDER-123'
    │    AND success = true
    │    AND event_type = 'OrderCreated'  -- Not ':REVERT'
    │
    │  Returns: [inventory ✅, shipping ✅]
    │
    ├─ Reverse order: [shipping, inventory]  ← LIFO!
    │
    ├─→ POST /api/shipping/{id}/cancel ✅ → UPSERT aggregate_results
    │                                         (aggregate_id, "shipping", "OrderCreated:REVERT")
    │
    └─→ DELETE /api/inventory/{id}     ✅ → UPSERT aggregate_results
                                             (aggregate_id, "inventory", "OrderCreated:REVERT")
```

**Key points:**

1. **Transactional Outbox** guarantees the event exists in the database (even if app crashes)
2. **Result Table** tracks every HTTP call's outcome (success/failure + response data)
3. **Saga Compensation** queries the result table and undoes successful steps in LIFO order
4. **The `:REVERT` suffix** ensures compensation results don't overwrite forward results

---

## The Fix: Outbox + Result Table + LIFO Compensation

Now the pieces fit together:

If the third call fails, we can't "roll back" the first two — those systems **do not support rollback**. So we design for **compensation**, not atomicity.

This means we intentionally track:

| What We Track              | Stored In                   | Why                                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Which API calls succeeded  | **Result Table**            | So we know what needs to be undone    |
| What each call returned    | **Result Table**            | So we know *which IDs* to undo with   |
| When retries are exhausted | **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** | So we know when to start compensation |

### The Recovery Sequence

When something fails:

1. Move the event to the **DLQ**
2. Look up all **successful** calls from the **Result Table**
3. **Undo them in reverse order** (LIFO), because dependencies matter
4. Mark the DLQ event **processed** once compensation succeeds

Example:

```
Forward direction:
1. reserveInventory → reservationId = "RES-456"
2. scheduleShipping  → shippingId    = "SHIP-789"
3. chargePayment     → ❌ fails

Compensating direction:
1. cancelShipping("SHIP-789")
2. releaseInventory("RES-456")
```

This guarantees:

- No stuck shipments
- No dangling inventory holds
- No orphan state that needs a human to fix it later

---

### Implementation Sketch (Simplified from Actual Code)

```scala
// 1) Inside the DB transaction: persist order + outbox event atomically
// Using the OutboxHelper.withEventFactory pattern
class OrderRepository extends OutboxHelper {

  def createWithEvent(order: Order): DBIO[Long] =
    withEventFactory((orders returning orders.map(_.id)) += order) { orderId =>
      OrderCreatedEvent(
        orderId = orderId,
        customerId = order.customerId,
        totalAmount = order.totalAmount,
        shippingType = order.shippingType
      )
    }
}

// The domain event expands to multiple destination payloads:
case class OrderCreatedEvent(
...) extends DomainEvent {
  def toOutboxEvent: OutboxEvent = OutboxEvent(
    aggregateId = orderId.toString,
    eventType = "OrderCreated",
    payloads = Map(
      "inventory" -> DestinationConfig(
        payload = Some(Json.obj("orderId" -> orderId, "items" ->...))
  ),
  "shipping" -> DestinationConfig(...),
  "billing" -> DestinationConfig(...)
  )
  )
}

// 2) Outside the transaction: Pekko OutboxProcessor + EventPublisher
// Process each destination, record results in aggregate_results table
for {
  inv <- publishTo("inventory", invPayload).recordResult
  ship <- publishTo("shipping", shipPayload).recordResult
  bill <- publishTo("billing", billPayload).recordResult
} yield {
  if (bill.success == false) {
    // ❌ Billing failed → move to DLQ for compensation
    dlqRepo.moveFromOutbox(event)
  } else {
    outboxRepo.markAsProcessed(event.id)
  }
}

// 3) DLQProcessor queries aggregate_results for successful calls
val successfulResults = resultRepo.findByAggregateId(
  aggregateId = orderId.toString,
  filter = Result.Success,
  includeReverts = false // Only forward flow
)

// 4) Compensate in LIFO order with ":REVERT" suffix
successfulResults.reverse.foreach { result =>
  val revertEndpoint = buildRevertEndpoint(result)
  publishTo(s"${result.destination}:REVERT", revertEndpoint)
}
```

**Why this works:**

- **Outbox**: never blocks on HTTP while the transaction is open
- **Result Table**: you know *exactly* which calls succeeded and the IDs needed to undo
- **Saga (LIFO)**: undo in reverse so dependencies are safe (cancel shipment → release inventory)

---

## Configuration-Driven Compensation

Here's where things get interesting. Automatic compensation is great, but how do you actually *build* those revert API calls? You need to extract IDs from previous responses, construct URLs with path parameters, and build payloads with the right data.

This section shows how the system does this entirely through configuration - no code changes needed when APIs change their endpoints or payloads. It's long, but worth it: you'll see how a single config file handles complex scenarios like conditional routing based on fraud scores and automatic retry header parsing.

### The Problem: How Do You Cancel a Shipment?

When billing fails, you need to call:

```
POST /api/shipping/{shippingId}/cancel
```

But where does `{shippingId}` come from? **The response from the original shipping API call!**

```json
// Original request:
POST /api/shipping
{
  "orderId": 123,
  "address": "..."
}

// Response stored in aggregate_results.response_payload:
{
  "shippingId": "SHIP-789",
  "trackingNumber": "1Z999AA1234567890",
  "estimatedDelivery": "2025-01-10"
}
```

### Configuration-Driven Extraction

In `application.conf`, you define **where to extract values** and **how to use them**:

```hocon
shipping {
  method = "POST"
  url = "http://localhost:9000/api/domestic-shipping"

  revert {
    url = "http://localhost:9000/api/domestic-shipping/{shipmentId}/cancel"
    method = "POST"

    # Extract variables from request/response
    extract {
      shipmentId = "response:$.shipmentId"    # From API response
      orderId = "response:$.orderId"          # From API response
      customerId = "request:$.customerId"     # From original request
    }

    # Template with placeholders
    payload = """
      {
        "reason": "payment_failed",
        "shipmentId": "{shipmentId}",
        "orderId": "{orderId}",
        "customerId": "{customerId}"
      }
    """
  }
}
```

### The Full Flow

```

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 2: Compensation - Build Revert Endpoint                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

DLQProcessor queries aggregate_results for successful calls:
  SELECT * FROM aggregate_results
  WHERE aggregate_id = '123'
    AND success = true
    AND event_type = 'OrderCreated'

For each result, extract values using JSONPath:
  shipmentId = "response:$.shipmentId"       → "SHIP-DOM-123-1704623400000"
  orderId = "response:$.orderId"             → "123"
  customerId = "request:$.customerId"        → "customer-123"

Replace placeholders in URL template:
  "/api/domestic-shipping/{shipmentId}/cancel" → "/api/domestic-shipping/SHIP-DOM-123-1704623400000/cancel"

Replace placeholders in payload template:
  {
    "reason": "payment_failed",
    "shipmentId": "{shipmentId}",   → "SHIP-DOM-123-1704623400000"
    "orderId": "{orderId}",         → "123"
    "customerId": "{customerId}"    → "customer-123"
  }

Send revert request:
  POST /api/domestic-shipping/SHIP-DOM-123-1704623400000/cancel
  Body: {"reason": "payment_failed", "shipmentId": "SHIP-DOM-123-1704623400000", "orderId": "123", "customerId": "customer-123"}

Store compensation result:
  event_type: "OrderCreated:REVERT"  ← Note the :REVERT suffix
  success: true
```

### Path Parameters in Action

The framework automatically replaces `{placeholders}` in URLs:

```hocon
inventory {
  url = "http://localhost:9000/api/inventory/reserve"

  revert {
    url = "http://localhost:9000/api/inventory/{reservationId}/release"
    method = "DELETE"

    extract {
      reservationId = "response:$.reservationId"   # From API response
    }
  }
}
```

**What happens:**

1. **Forward call response:**
   ```json
   {
     "reservationId": "RES-456",
     "orderId": 123,
     "warehouseId": "WH-NYC-01",
     "warehouse": {
       "id": "WH-NYC-01",
       "name": "NYC Distribution Center",
       "location": {"city": "New York", "state": "NY", "country": "US"}
     },
     "items": [{"sku": "PROD-001", "quantity": 2, "reserved": true, "binLocation": "A5-12"}],
     "shippingType": "domestic",
     "status": "reserved",
     "expiresAt": 1704671400000,
     "reservedAt": 1704670500000
   }
   ```

2. **DLQProcessor extracts:**
    - `reservationId` → `"RES-456"`

3. **URL template becomes:**
   ```
   http://localhost:9000/api/inventory/RES-456/release
   ```

4. **Compensation call:**
   ```
   DELETE /api/inventory/RES-456/release
   ```

### Conditional Routing: Dynamic Destination Selection

**Routes can be selected dynamically** based on request data or previous API responses.

**Example 1:** Shipping based on original request (no `previousDestination`):

```hocon
shipping {
  method = "POST"
  routes = [
    {
      url = "http://localhost:9000/api/domestic-shipping"
      condition {
        jsonPath = "$.shippingType"
        operator = "eq"
        value = "domestic"
      }
    },
    {
      url = "http://localhost:9000/api/international-shipping"
      condition {
        jsonPath = "$.shippingType"
        operator = "eq"
        value = "international"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example 2:** Billing based on fraud check (using `previousDestination`):

```hocon
# Sequence: inventory → fraudCheck → shipping → billing
fanout {
  OrderCreated = ["inventory", "fraudCheck", "shipping", "billing"]
}

# Fraud check returns risk score
fraudCheck {
  url = "http://localhost:9000/api/fraud/check"
  method = "POST"
  # Response: {"riskScore": 75, "riskLevel": "high", ...}
}

# Billing routes based on fraudCheck response
billing {
  method = "POST"
  routes = [
    {
      # Low-risk: standard billing
      url = "http://localhost:9000/api/billing"
      condition {
        jsonPath = "$.riskScore"
        operator = "lt"
        value = "50"
        previousDestination = "fraudCheck"  # ← Check fraudCheck API response!
      }
      revert {
        url = "http://localhost:9000/api/billing/{transactionId}/refund"
        method = "POST"
        extract {
          transactionId = "response:$.transaction.id"
          amount = "request:$.amount"
          currency = "request:$.currency"
        }
        payload = """{"transactionId": "{transactionId}", "amount": "{amount}", "currency": "{currency}", "reason": "order_failed"}"""
      }
    },
    {
      # High-risk: high-value processor with additional verification
      url = "http://localhost:9000/api/high-value-processing"
      condition {
        jsonPath = "$.riskScore"
        operator = "gte"
        value = "50"
        previousDestination = "fraudCheck"  # ← Check fraudCheck API response!
      }
      revert {
        url = "http://localhost:9000/api/high-value-processing/{processingId}/cancel"
        method = "POST"
        extract {
          processingId = "response:$.processingId"
          amount = "request:$.amount"
          currency = "request:$.currency"
        }
        payload = """{"processingId": "{processingId}", "amount": "{amount}", "currency": "{currency}", "reason": "order_failed"}"""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**What happens:**

1. **Fraud check API responds:**
   ```json
   {
     "status": "success",
     "riskScore": 75,
     "riskLevel": "high",
     "checks": {
       "addressVerification": "passed",
       "cvvCheck": "passed",
       "velocityCheck": "flagged"
     },
     "timestamp": 1704670500000
   }
   ```

2. **Billing evaluates conditions:**
    - **Without `previousDestination`**: Checks `$.riskScore` in **original request** → Not found!
    - **With `previousDestination="fraudCheck"`**: Checks `$.riskScore` in **fraudCheck response** → 75
    - Evaluates: `75 >= 50` → TRUE
    - Selects: `high-value-processing` route

3. **Records which route was taken:**
   ```
   aggregate_results.endpoint_url = "http://localhost:9000/api/high-value-processing"
   ```

4. **During compensation:**
    - Queries `aggregate_results` for the exact URL used
    - Calls high-value processor's cancel endpoint (not standard billing refund)

**Key insight:** `previousDestination` enables **decision chaining** - one API's response influences the next API's route. Essential for risk-based routing, feature flags, and context-dependent decisions.

### Respecting Rate Limits: Retry-After Header Support

Real-world APIs impose rate limits and experience temporary outages. The system automatically respects server-specified retry delays using the `Retry-After` header.

**The Problem:**

```
Your system: Makes 100 requests/second to billing API
Billing API: Rate limit is 10 requests/second
Result: 90% of your requests get 429 Too Many Requests
```

**Without Retry-After handling:** You keep retrying immediately, making the problem worse (retry storm).

**With Retry-After handling:** You wait exactly as long as the server tells you to.

#### Example 1: Fraud Check API with Auto-Detection

Real-world fraud check APIs (Stripe Radar, Sift, etc.) often impose rate limits:

```hocon
fraudCheck {
  url = "http://localhost:9000/api/fraud/check"
  method = "POST"

  retryAfter {
    headerName = "Retry-After"  # Standard HTTP header
    format = "auto"              # Auto-detect format (seconds, unix, ISO 8601, etc.)
    fallbackSeconds = 30         # If header missing, wait 30 seconds
  }
}
```

**What happens:**

```
Request → POST /api/fraud/check
Response → 429 Too Many Requests
           Retry-After: 15

System schedules retry for 15 seconds from now (not immediately!)
```

#### Example 2: Custom Header with Unix Timestamp (GitHub-Style)

GitHub uses `X-RateLimit-Reset` with Unix epoch timestamp:

```hocon
github {
  url = "https://api.github.com/repos/user/repo"
  method = "GET"

  retryAfter {
    headerName = "X-RateLimit-Reset"  # Custom header name
    format = "unix"                    # Unix epoch seconds
    fallbackSeconds = 3600             # Wait 1 hour if header missing
  }
}
```

**Response headers:**

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1704585600  # Unix timestamp
```

The system parses the timestamp and schedules retry at that exact time.

#### Example 3: Retry Info in JSON Body

Some APIs return retry timing in the response body:

```hocon
customApi {
  url = "https://api.example.com/process"
  method = "POST"

  retryAfter {
    fromBody = true                        # Look in response body, not headers
    jsonPath = "$.rateLimit.retryAfter"   # JSONPath to retry delay
    format = "seconds"
    fallbackSeconds = 30
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "unavailable",
  "message": "Service temporarily unavailable",
  "rateLimit": {
    "retryAfter": 20,
    "reason": "maintenance_window"
  }
}
```

System extracts `20` from `$.rateLimit.retryAfter` and waits 20 seconds.

#### Supported Formats

The system automatically detects and parses multiple formats:

| Format         | Example                         | Description                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `auto`         | Tries all formats below         | Default - smartly detects format |
| `seconds`      | `15`                            | Delay in seconds from now        |
| `milliseconds` | `15000`                         | Delay in milliseconds from now   |
| `unix`         | `1704585600`                    | Absolute Unix epoch seconds      |
| `httpDate`     | `Wed, 21 Oct 2025 07:28:00 GMT` | RFC 1123 HTTP date format        |
| `iso8601`      | `2025-10-21T07:28:00Z`          | ISO 8601 timestamp               |

#### What Happens When Rate Limited

```
1. OutboxProcessor tries to publish event
   ↓
2. API responds: 429 Too Many Requests
   Retry-After: 30
   ↓
3. System parses header: "Wait 30 seconds"
   ↓
4. UPDATE outbox_events SET
   status = 'PENDING',
   next_retry_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '30 seconds',
   retry_count = retry_count + 1
   ↓
5. PostgreSQL trigger fires when next_retry_at <= NOW()
   ↓
6. OutboxProcessor wakes up at exact time and retries
```

---

### What's Config-Driven vs What's Not

Let's be clear about what still requires code changes:

#### ❌ NOT Config-Driven: Forward Flow

**You still need Scala code** to add a new destination to the forward flow:

```scala
// Must update domain event to include new destination
case class OrderCreatedEvent(...) extends DomainEvent {
  def toOutboxEvent: OutboxEvent = OutboxEvent(
    aggregateId = orderId.toString,
    eventType = "OrderCreated",
    payloads = Map(
      "inventory" -> DestinationConfig(payload = ...),
  "shipping" -> DestinationConfig(payload = ...),
  "billing" -> DestinationConfig(payload = ...),
  "email" -> DestinationConfig(payload = ...) // ← New: requires code change
  )
  )
}
```

#### ✅ Config-Driven: Compensation + Routing

**No code changes needed** for:

- Revert endpoint URLs and placeholders
- JSONPath extraction from request/response
- Conditional routing
- Payload templates for compensation

```hocon
# Just add this to application.conf - no Scala code needed
inventory {
  method = "POST"
  url = "http://localhost:9000/api/inventory/reserve"

  revert {
    url = "http://localhost:9000/api/inventory/{reservationId}/release"
    method = "DELETE"
    extract {
      reservationId = "response:$.reservationId"
    }
  }
}
```

## Manual Cancellation: User-Initiated Compensation

So far we've discussed **automatic compensation** triggered by the DLQ when APIs fail after retries. But what about **user-initiated cancellations**?

Real-world scenarios:

- Customer cancels their order within 5 minutes
- Support agent needs to refund a transaction
- User clicks "Cancel Subscription" button
- Admin manually reverses a failed operation

**The insight:** We can reuse the exact same compensation machinery by inserting a **revert event** into the outbox.

### The `!EventType` Notation

When a user cancels, the system creates a domain event with the `!` prefix:

```scala
// User clicks "Cancel Order" button
POST /api/orders/{orderId}/cancel
```

```scala
// Domain event with ! prefix (models/DomainEvent.scala)
case class OrderCancelledEvent(
                                orderId: Long,
                                reason: String,
                                timestamp: Instant = Instant.now()
                              ) extends DomainEvent {
  override def aggregateId: String = orderId.toString

  override def eventType: String = "!OrderCreated" // ← ! prefix triggers compensation

  override def toPayload: JsValue = Json.obj(
    "orderId" -> orderId,
    "reason" -> reason,
    "timestamp" -> timestamp.toString
  )
}

// Repository uses OutboxHelper to transactionally insert event (repositories/OrderRepository.scala)
def cancelWithEvent(orderId: Long, reason: String): DBIO[Int] =
  for {
    orderOpt <- findById(orderId)
    _ <- orderOpt match {
      case Some(_) => DBIO.successful(())
      case None => DBIO.failed(new NoSuchElementException(s"Order $orderId not found"))
    }
    // Both DB update AND outbox event happen atomically
    updated <- withEvent(
      OrderCancelledEvent(
        orderId = orderId,
        reason = reason
      )
    ) {
      orders
        .filter(_.id === orderId)
        .map(o => (o.orderStatus, o.updatedAt))
        .update(("CANCELLED", Instant.now()))
    }
  } yield updated
```

**The magic:** `withEvent()` from `OutboxHelper` transactionally:

1. Updates the order status to `CANCELLED`
2. Inserts `!OrderCreated` event into `outbox_events`
3. Both succeed or both fail (atomicity guaranteed)

### What Happens Next

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 1: User Action → Outbox Event                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

User clicks "Cancel Order" (orderId: 123)
    ↓
Controller inserts into outbox_events:
  aggregate_id: "123"
  event_type: "!OrderCreated"  ← Revert event
  payloads: {}
  status: PENDING
    ↓
pg_notify('outbox_events_channel')

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 2: HttpEventPublisher Detects Revert Event                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

OutboxProcessor picks up event:
  eventType.startsWith("!") → true
    ↓
Strip prefix: "!OrderCreated" → "OrderCreated"
    ↓
Lookup fanout config: OrderCreated → ["billing", "shipping", "inventory"]
    ↓
Reverse order (LIFO): ["inventory", "shipping", "billing"]
    ↓
Convert to Revert destinations: [Revert("inventory"), Revert("shipping"), Revert("billing")]

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 3: Query Successful Forward Calls                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

For each Revert destination, query aggregate_results:
  SELECT * FROM aggregate_results
  WHERE aggregate_id = '123'
    AND destination = 'billing'        ← Check each destination
    AND event_type = 'OrderCreated'    ← Forward flow only
    AND success = true                 ← Only successful calls

Results:
  - billing: ✅ Success (transactionId: "TX-456")
  - shipping: ✅ Success (shippingId: "SHIP-789")
  - inventory: ✅ Success (reservationId: "RES-123")

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 4: Build Revert Endpoints from Forward Results             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

For billing (from aggregate_results):
  request_payload: {"amount": 99.99, "currency": "USD", "timestamp": "2025-01-07T10:30:00Z"}
  response_payload: {
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Payment processed successfully",
    "transaction": {
      "id": "TXN-123-1704623400000",
      "amount": 99.99,
      "currency": "USD",
      "status": "completed",
      "processedAt": 1704623400000
    },
    "aggregateId": "123",
    "timestamp": 1704623400000
  }

Extract using config:
  billing.revert.extract {
    transactionId = "response:$.transaction.id" → "TXN-123-1704623400000"
    amount = "request:$.amount" → 99.99
    currency = "request:$.currency" → "USD"
  }

Build revert URL:
  Template: "/api/billing/{transactionId}/refund"
  Result: "/api/billing/TXN-123-1704623400000/refund"

Build revert payload:
  Template: {"transactionId": "{transactionId}", "amount": "{amount}", "currency": "{currency}", "reason": "order_failed"}
  Result: {"transactionId": "TXN-123-1704623400000", "amount": 99.99, "currency": "USD", "reason": "order_failed"}

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 5: Execute Compensation in LIFO Order                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Call revert APIs:
  1. DELETE /api/inventory/RES-123        ✅ → UPSERT aggregate_results
                                                (aggregate_id: "123",
                                                 destination: "inventory",
                                                 event_type: "OrderCreated:REVERT")

  2. POST /api/shipping/SHIP-789/cancel   ✅ → UPSERT aggregate_results
                                                (aggregate_id: "123",
                                                 destination: "shipping",
                                                 event_type: "OrderCreated:REVERT")

  3. POST /api/billing/TX-456/refund      ✅ → UPSERT aggregate_results
                                                (aggregate_id: "123",
                                                 destination: "billing",
                                                 event_type: "OrderCreated:REVERT")

Mark outbox event as PROCESSED
```

### Key Differences: Manual vs Automatic Compensation

| Aspect             | Manual (`!OrderCreated` in outbox) | Automatic (DLQ)                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Trigger**        | User action (cancel button)        | Forward API fails after max retries |
| **Table**          | `outbox_events`                    | `dead_letter_events`                |
| **Payloads**       | Empty (queries DB)                 | Copied from original event          |
| **Timing**         | Immediate (user-initiated)         | After retry exhaustion              |
| **Use Case**       | Cancellations, refunds             | Failure recovery                    |
| **Retry Behavior** | Standard outbox retries            | Separate DLQ retry count            |

### What If Compensation Fails?

**For manual cancellations:**

```scala
// In OutboxProcessor.scala (lines 324-333)
val isRevertEvent = event.eventType.startsWith("!")

if (isRevertEvent) {
  // Revert events don't go to DLQ - they're already compensation!
  // Mark as failed and require manual intervention
  log.error(
    s"Revert event ${event.id} (${event.eventType}) exceeded retries - " +
      s"marking as FAILED, requires manual intervention"
  )
  db.run(outboxRepo.markProcessed(event.id)).map(_ => false)
}
```

**Critical insight:** Revert events **never go to DLQ** because:

- They're already compensation operations
- "Reverting the revert" would create infinite loops
- Failed compensation requires human judgment

If `!OrderCreated` fails after retries:

1. ❌ Mark as `PROCESSED` with error
2. ⚠️ Alert operations team
3. 👤 Manual intervention required (retry via admin UI, contact vendor, etc.)

### Example: Idempotent Compensation

What if the user clicks "Cancel" twice?

```
First cancellation:
  INSERT INTO outbox_events (aggregate_id: "123", event_type: "!OrderCreated")
    ↓
  Query aggregate_results for successful forward calls
    ↓
  Found: billing ✅, shipping ✅, inventory ✅
    ↓
  Execute compensation: DELETE inventory, cancel shipping, refund billing
    ↓
  Store results: "OrderCreated:REVERT" for each destination

Second cancellation (5 seconds later):
  INSERT INTO outbox_events (aggregate_id: "123", event_type: "!OrderCreated")
    ↓
  Query aggregate_results for successful forward calls
    ↓
  Check: Already compensated? (event_type = "OrderCreated:REVERT" exists)
    ↓
  Skip: No compensation needed
    ↓
  Mark outbox event as PROCESSED (no-op)
```

The system is **naturally idempotent** because:

- `aggregate_results` tracks both forward and revert calls
- Before compensating, it checks if `OrderCreated:REVERT` already exists
- If already compensated, gracefully skips (no duplicate refunds!)

### Real-World Use Cases

**1. Subscription Cancellation:**

```scala
// User cancels subscription
db.run {
  outboxEvents += OutboxEvent(
    aggregateId = subscriptionId.toString,
    eventType = "!SubscriptionActivated",
    payloads = Map.empty
  )
}
// → Reverts: payment gateway, email service, analytics tracking
```

**2. Refund Request:**

```scala
// Support agent initiates refund
db.run {
  outboxEvents += OutboxEvent(
    aggregateId = orderId.toString,
    eventType = "!OrderCreated",
    payloads = Map.empty
  )
}
// → Reverts: billing (refund), shipping (cancel), inventory (release)
```

**3. Feature Flag Rollback:**

```scala
// Admin disables feature for specific user
db.run {
  outboxEvents += OutboxEvent(
    aggregateId = userId.toString,
    eventType = "!FeatureEnabled",
    payloads = Map.empty
  )
}
// → Reverts: license server, usage tracking, notification service
```

### The Power of Reusing Compensation Logic

By using the `!` prefix convention:

- ✅ Same configuration (revert URLs, extract rules)
- ✅ Same compensation code path (LIFO, idempotency)
- ✅ Same audit trail (`aggregate_results` with `:REVERT` suffix)
- ✅ Same monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Unified operational runbooks

**One compensation engine, two triggers:**

1. Automatic: DLQ when forward APIs fail
2. Manual: `!EventType` when users/admins cancel

---

## The Three Tables (Why Each Exists)

### 1. `outbox_events` — The Work Queue

```sql
CREATE TABLE outbox_events
(
    id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_id    VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,         -- "ORDER-123"
    event_type      VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,         -- "OrderCreated"
    payloads        JSONB        NOT NULL,         -- {"inventory": {...}, "shipping": {...}}
    status          VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING', -- PENDING → PROCESSING → PROCESSED
    retry_count     INT         DEFAULT 0,
    next_retry_at   TIMESTAMP,                     -- NULL = ready now
    idempotency_key VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL          -- Prevent duplicates
);

-- Unique constraint: prevent duplicate events
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_outbox_idempotency ON outbox_events (idempotency_key)
    WHERE status != 'PROCESSED';
```

**Purpose**: One row = one business event that fans out to N destinations.

### 2. `aggregate_results` — The Audit Log (Enables Compensation)

```sql
CREATE TABLE aggregate_results
(
    id               BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_id     VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL, -- "ORDER-123"
    event_type       VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL, -- "OrderCreated" or "OrderCreated:REVERT"
    destination      VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL, -- "inventory", "shipping", etc.
    endpoint_url     VARCHAR(1024) NOT NULL, -- Actual URL called
    request_payload  JSONB,                  -- What we sent
    response_payload JSONB,                  -- What they returned (contains IDs!)
    success          BOOLEAN       NOT NULL, -- Did it work?
    published_at     TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Unique constraint: one result per aggregate+destination+event_type
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_aggregate_results_unique
    ON aggregate_results (aggregate_id, destination, event_type);
```

**Purpose**: One row = one HTTP call to one destination. Tracks:

- Which calls succeeded (for compensation)
- Response IDs needed for revert (e.g., `shippingId` to cancel)
- Complete audit trail

**The `:REVERT` suffix** ensures forward and revert results coexist:

- `event_type = "OrderCreated"` → forward flow
- `event_type = "OrderCreated:REVERT"` → compensation flow

### 3. `dead_letter_events` — The Compensation Queue

```sql
CREATE TABLE dead_letter_events
(
    id                 BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    original_event_id  BIGINT        NOT NULL,
    aggregate_id       VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL,
    event_type         VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL,
    payloads           JSONB         NOT NULL,
    status             VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING', -- Compensation status
    revert_retry_count INT         DEFAULT 0,         -- Retry compensation
    failed_at          TIMESTAMP   DEFAULT NOW(),
    reason             VARCHAR(1024) NOT NULL
);
```

**Purpose**: Events that exhausted retries. Triggers compensation.

---

## PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY: Instant Event Processing

Instead of polling every N seconds, we use database triggers:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_new_outbox_event()
    RETURNS trigger AS
$$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.status = 'PENDING' AND (
        TG_OP = 'INSERT' OR
        (OLD.status IS DISTINCT FROM 'PENDING' AND
         (NEW.next_retry_at IS NULL OR NEW.next_retry_at <= NOW()))
        ) THEN
        PERFORM pg_notify('outbox_events_channel', NEW.id::text);
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER outbox_event_inserted
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OF status
    ON outbox_events
    FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_new_outbox_event();
```

The Pekko actor subscribes to `outbox_events_channel` and wakes up **instantly** when:

- New events are inserted
- Events become ready for retry (`next_retry_at <= NOW()`)

---

## Running the Example

Want to see it in action? The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hanishi/never-call-apis-inside-database-transactions) includes a complete working example.

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/hanishi/never-call-apis-inside-database-transactions
cd never-call-apis-inside-database-transactions
docker-compose up -d postgres
sbt run

# Open http://localhost:9000
```

The repository includes:
- Interactive UI for creating orders and triggering failures
- Configurable failure rates to test compensation
- Complete database schema with sample queries
- Detailed README with step-by-step walkthrough

Try it yourself to see the patterns in action:
- **Happy path**: All API calls succeed
- **Automatic compensation**: Billing fails, system reverts in LIFO order
- **Manual cancellation**: User cancels, all APIs compensated
- **Audit trail**: Query `aggregate_results` to see every API call

### Testing Compensation

Want to see compensation in action? Edit `conf/application.conf` to make billing always fail:

```hocon
service.failure.rates {
  billing.charge = 1.0  # Change from 0.3 to 1.0 (100% failure rate)
  # ... other settings ...
}
```

Restart the application and create an order - you'll see automatic LIFO compensation as the system reverts shipping and inventory reservations.

## Let Me Be Honest With You

### This Isn't a Silver Bullet

The patterns in this blog post don't make distributed systems "easy."
They make them **survivable**.

- You'll still get paged at 3 AM
- You'll still have to write runbooks for edge cases
- You'll still need monitoring, alerting, and operational discipline
- You'll still encounter failure modes you never imagined

### But Here's What You Gain

Instead of debugging:

- "Why was the customer charged, but there's no order in the database?"
- "Why is inventory reserved for orders that don't exist?"
- "How do I find all the orphaned shipments from last week's outage?"

You'll be debugging:

- "Why is this DLQ retry taking longer than expected?"
- "Should we increase the retry backoff for this destination?"
- "Can we optimize this compensation query?"

**The failure modes become manageable.**
The 3 AM pages become fixable. The data inconsistencies become **impossible by design**.

### If You Remember Nothing Else

**Never call external APIs inside a database transaction.**

That one rule - enforced by these patterns - prevents an entire class of distributed systems bugs that have haunted production systems since the dawn of microservices.

Distributed systems are hard. But they don't have to be **that** hard.
