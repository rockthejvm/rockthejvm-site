biography: Staff Software Engineer specializing in Data Engineering, working on shaping large-scale systems. I build unapologetically honest data platforms and open source work, while happily saving space for chai-fuelled stories, road trips, cars, watches, speak at and support conferences, and turning all that into practical, welcoming playbooks for engineers and teams.
