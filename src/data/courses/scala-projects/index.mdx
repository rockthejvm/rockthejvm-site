    biography: <p>Haoyi Li is a software engineer and the author of com-lihaoyi, an ecosystem of popular open-source Scala libraries, including os-lib, uPickle, Cask and Scalatags, which we used in this course. He is also the author of the book Hands-On Scala Programming, which he gracefully allowed me to use as an inspiration for 4 out of 6 projects of this course. I took his code examples in the book to a more "product-like" state, with refactorings and a more functional-style Scala, so that the total overlap with his book is about 30%. You'll get a lot of value from this course even if (especially if) you have his book close by.</p><p>Haoyi is also the creator of the Mill build tool, which he recently released as 1.0.</p>

### Build real things with Scala.

So you've just learned Scala. You know the basics, you can write some code, but you don't feel comfortable enough to build real applications.

Maybe you'd like to start building your own projects, but you don't know where to start. Looking for some ideas of practical and fun projects to build, so that you can say you're a real Scala developer.

This course is for you. In here, you will build real applications with Scala, from scratch. Maybe one of them will be the starting point for your next startup.

<Fragment slot="verticalSection">

<br/>
Each project takes about 2 hours to complete - enough for an evening hack session - but with plenty of room for expanding into something more serious if you like the project or want to use it yourself.

At the beginning of every project, you'll get a tutorial on the libraries we'll use, then we'll go lasers blazing into the project itself.

Let me tell you about the projects:

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="skills">
### After this course, you'll be able to:
- use Scala as a fast, productive language for the task at hand
- pick the right tools and libraries for a Scala project
- use either plain Scala or straightforward libraries (instead of effect systems or magical frameworks) for powerful applications
- deploy your Scala applications to the target of your choice
- hopefully, use the projects you've built or turn them into real products!
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="feature1">
### Project 1: PhotoScala
This is a command-line image editor, which can transform pictures in various ways. You can crop, resize, apply filters and effects, and combine multiple images together.

We architect this app so that you can add as many other transformations, effects and filters as you want. The code is modular and easy to extend.

You'll learn

- how to work with pictures
- image effects
- blend modes (the kind of stuff you see in Photoshop)
- kernel filters like blur, sharpen, emboss and edge detection
- not least, how to build a command line
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="feature2">
### Project 2: ScrapeYard

This is a web scraper, which can scrape any website and extract useful information from it. You can use it to scrape news articles, product information, or any other kind of data.

We'll write different scrapers for different sites (including Rock the JVM!), and by the end of this project we'll be able to extract news headlines from a popular site and send them to you over email, instead of endless doom-scrolling.

You'll learn

- parsing real websites
- recursive scraping (e.g. on forums)
- parallel crawling
- sending emails
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="feature3">
### Project 3: Statick
In this project, we'll build a static site generator.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a personal Markdown-based programming blog deployed on GitHub Pages, with syntax highlighting and all.

It takes far less code than you think, it looks great and you can expand it into a full-blown framework if you want.

You'll learn

- static site rendering
- deploying a website to a popular hosting platform
- adding configuration
- syntax highlighting
- templating
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="feature4">
### Project 4: Chattie

This is a full-stack Scala application in the style of WhatsApp. Multiple users can connect to a chat room, and send messages and replies, with persistent storage. When a user logs in, they see the full chat history.

You'll learn

- using databases
- exposing web servers
- frontend with ScalaJS
- sharing domain model (so underrated!)
- real-time updates with websockets
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="feature5">
### Project 5: ScalaDrive
This is a real-time file synchronizer. Works real fast: I try cloning my big Typelevel Rite of Passage repo on camera and it's instantly mirrored on the other side. The screenshot doesn't do it justic: I'm cloning the repo in `indir` and it's instantly mirrored in `outdir`.

You'll learn

- parallelizing workloads with actors
- file management
- spawning processes
- inter-process communication
- communicating remotely across the network
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="feature6">
### Project 6: RAGnarok

This is an AI chatbot trained on my own blog on camera. It's able to give you contextualized answers with code examples and references where it found the information.

You'll learn how to build your own AI agent trained on your own data.

Enough said!
