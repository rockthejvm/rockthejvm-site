### Build real things with Scala.

So you've just learned Scala. You know the basics, you can write some code, but you don't feel comfortable enough to build real applications.

Maybe you'd like to start building your own projects, but you don't know where to start. Looking for some ideas of practical and fun projects to build, so that you can say you're a real Scala developer.

This course is for you. In here, you will build real applications with Scala, from scratch. Maybe one of them will be the starting point for your next startup.
