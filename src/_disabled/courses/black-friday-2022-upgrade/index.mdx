description: If you bought the Black Friday bundle in 2022, this is for you - get all courses published since, at an outrageous price.
excerpt: "<p>Contains both Rite of Passage courses (each worth $495), all of Kotlin, plus Scala Projects + Metaprogramming courses</p>"
faqs:
  - question: Will I get the same courses as in the full Black Friday bundle?
    answer: Yes, that's the point!
  - question: Does this bundle contain all the updates to the included courses?
    answer: Yes, you'll get the latest versions of all the included courses.
  - question: Can I get a refund if I'm unhappy with this bundle?
    answer: In the absolutely remote chance that you are - just email me and you'll have your money back.
  - question: Is this the same as a lifetime membership?
    answer: You get the included courses for life, BUT this bundle doesn't contain any future courses, unlike the monthly/yearly membership.
  - question: What about updates?
    answer: All the included courses come with free updates, so you'll get all of them for free.
  - question: Does this include access to the private Rock the JVM community?
    answer: You bet!
  - question: I bought a course at X dollars and I'm thinking about getting this bundle. Do you offer discounts?
    answer: This pack already comes at an outrageous price, so it doesn't have additional discounts. "Discount" is its middle name, for crying out loud 😄

This bundle is for you if you bought an older Black Friday bundle, and you want to upgrade to all the latest courses published since then.

If you bought a Black Friday bundle, you know what Rock the JVM is all about and what you're getting, and I appreciate your trust. Check the courses included below. I promise the bundle is as good a deal as the BF pack you bought before.

This is the single best investment you can make this year. The ROI is >100% the moment you step into your job after one of these courses, and the sky is the limit with what you can achieve.

And in the one in a trillion chance you don't like it, you get your money back.

What are you waiting for?
