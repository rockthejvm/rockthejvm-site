description: Learn everything about Kotlin, from zero to master.
bundledCourses: [kotlin-essentials, advanced-kotlin]
faqs:
  - question: Does this bundle cover Android?
    answer: Not yet - the bundle currently focuses on Kotlin mastery as a language, so that you can apply these skills on any platform, including Android of course!
  - question: How is a typical lesson?
    answer: We generally create separate mini-applications where we'll explore a certain feature of the Kotlin language, with examples and exercises. Each lesson is about 10-30 mins long.
  - question: Is this Kotlin masterclass hard?
    answer: If you have some existing experience coding in another language, this bundle will give you a consistent brain stretch, but not so much that you burn out. If you're stuck on something, we're happy to help in our private community.
  - question: Do you give a certificate?
    answer: Yep! Every course comes with its own certificate once you finish it, so that you can reimburse this bundle with your employer or get a Kotlin job.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enroll, you'll automatically get a tax-compliant receipt which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: I'm already an advanced Kotlin user. Should I take this bundle?
    answer: Then I think you're good.
  - question: I'm a senior and want to give this bundle to some juniors in my team, can I audit this bundle?
    answer: Happy to help - reach out at daniel@rockthejvm.com.
  - question: What if I don't like the bundle?
    answer: Money back, easy ðŸ’° Only a handful of people ever asked for a refund on the entire site of 20+ courses, just to give you an idea.
