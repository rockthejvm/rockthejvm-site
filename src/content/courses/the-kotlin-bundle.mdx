description: Learn everything about Kotlin, from zero to master.
excerpt: <p>Become a Kotlin master from scratch. Take all Kotlin courses at a discount, write thousands of lines of code, and become one of the top developers in weeks instead of years.</p>
faqs:
  - question: Does this bundle cover Android?
    answer: Not yet - the bundle currently focuses on Kotlin mastery as a language, so that you can apply these skills on any platform, including Android of course!
  - question: How is a typical lesson?
    answer: We generally create separate mini-applications where we'll explore a certain feature of the Kotlin language, with examples and exercises. Each lesson is about 10-30 mins long.
  - question: Is this Kotlin masterclass hard?
    answer: If you have some existing experience coding in another language, this bundle will give you a consistent brain stretch, but not so much that you burn out. If you're stuck on something, we're happy to help in our private community.
  - question: Do you give a certificate?
    answer: Yep! Every course comes with its own certificate once you finish it, so that you can reimburse this bundle with your employer or get a Kotlin job.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enroll, you'll automatically get a tax-compliant receipt which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: I'm already an advanced Kotlin user. Should I take this bundle?
    answer: Then I think you're good.
  - question: I'm a senior and want to give this bundle to some juniors in my team, can I audit this bundle?
    answer: Happy to help - reach out at daniel@rockthejvm.com.
  - question: What if I don't like the bundle?
    answer: Money back, easy ðŸ’° Only a handful of people ever asked for a refund on the entire site of 20+ courses, just to give you an idea.

    ### Become a Kotlin pro.

    If you're on this page, Kotlin will need no introduction. You know the basics, and you've written your fair share of Kotlin in production for your projects, either personal or at work.

    Perhaps your codebase has become larger than you can manage, or you would like to become a senior developer, or need to write libraries and tools for other team members.

    For this, you need **deep knowledge** of Kotlin's type system and internals, so that you can create the best tools.

    **This course is for you.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="question">
    ### Oh yeah.
    You already know that Kotlin is such a game changer. It's very pragmatic, very flexible, has a powerful compiler, and allows you to write concise code that's easy for other people to understand.

    But there's far more to it.

    Beyond essentials OOP or functional principles, Kotlin has features that few developers have mastered. Kotlin's type system is among the best on the JVM, and the tools to manipulate types and code at runtime are top notch.

    With these tools, you can write **libraries, tools for other developers, frameworks for large codebases**, and much more.

    This is what you'll learn in this advanced Kotlin course.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature1">
    ### Who is this course is for?
    This course is best for **Kotlin developers who need to deeply understand the internals of Kotlin** and use its type system to write complex applications, libraries, tools, code generators or analyzers.

    **If you're a Kotlin developer looking to become senior, this course is for you.**

    If this is your first time with Kotlin, the [Kotlin Essentials](/courses/kotlin-essentials) course is your best starting point.

    And rest assured - if you buy this course and find that it's not for you, you'll get your money back anytime ðŸ’°.

    This course is 100% hands-on - this picture shows the code we write in this course.

    ### Platform Agnostic
    Many people learn Kotlin to build Android apps. Like the [Kotlin Essentials course](/courses/kotlin-essentials), **this advanced course does <ins>not</ins> focus on Android**, but on Kotlin itself.

    The skills you get in this course will allow you to build **complex systems, libraries and tools for other developers**. Notice that this applies to Android, the JVM, native code, KotlinJS, or anything else - **this course transcends any platform!**

    If you are specifically looking for an Android course, this course is still useful because after you finish this course, you can study the Android specifics without thinking too much about Kotlin - because by this time it will be second nature to you.

    **Regardless of what your goal is, this Kotlin course will help you no matter where you deploy your code.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature3">
    ### 100% Practical
    As always, **code is king, and we write it from scratch.**

    We don't waste time on endless theory, and I only use a few slides every lesson as "flashcards" you can come back to. You'll also get the slides in PDF for easy recall.

    Besides the dozens of examples that demonstrate the most complex Kotlin features, we spend a lot of time in **real-life exercises**, where we try to write (at small scale) the same kind of tools you'd be in charge of at work.

    The picture you see here is a mini-library we write in the course for HTML rendering with a nice DSL.

    In the process, you'll get hands-on experience not only with the hard Kotlin features, but you'll get a sense of **what it's like to write complex code** for other people.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="skills">
    ### After this course, you'll be able to:
    - <p>understand the most complex Kotlin features</p>
    - <p>contribute to complex codebases</p>
    - <p>write libraries and tools for other developers</p>
    - <p>use the Kotlin type system for generic, easily reusable code</p>
    - <p>write frameworks that generate or analyze other source code</p>

    ### Skills you'll get:

    - <p>Kotlin type system mastery</p>
      - <p>OOP and FP (obviously)</p>
      - <p>Delegation and delegated properties</p>
      - <p>Using delegated properties in the standard library for specific contexts</p>
      - <p>Simplifying your types</p>
      - <p>Using advanced generics with variance</p>
      - <p>Understanding the compiler type-checker and variance positions</p>
    - <p>Kotlin internals proficiency</p>
      - <p>Contracts and compiler type checks</p>
      - <p>Inline functions and performance optimization</p>
      - <p>Avoiding JVM type erasure</p>
      - <p>Using reified types</p>
      - <p>Using reflection for manipulating and using code dynamically at runtime</p>
      - <p>Creating code generators and analyzers</p>
      - <p>Writing symbol processors</p>

    <p>and much more, all with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.</p>

    ### Plus some extra perks:

        - You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (1800+ LOC)
        - You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
        - You'll have access to the takeaway slides
