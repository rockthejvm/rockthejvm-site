# faqs:
#  Is this course hard?
# This course was designed to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
# I've never written Scala or Akka before. Should I take this course?
# You should take the beginner Scala and Akka training first. We also have ~40 minutes of Scala/Akka overview at the beginning of the course, but that won't give you the skills you need if you've never seen this before.
# I'm comfortable with both Scala and Akka and I want to make my actors live forever. Should I take this course?
# Yes! This course is for you.
