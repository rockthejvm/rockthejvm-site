# faqs:
#  Is this course hard?
# This course was designed to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
# I've never written Scala or Akka before. Should I take this course?
# You should take the beginner Scala and Akka training first. We also have ~40 minutes of Scala/Akka overview at the beginning of the course, but that won't give you the skills you need if you've never seen this before.
# I'm comfortable with both Scala and Akka and I want to make my actors live forever. Should I take this course?
# Yes! This course is for you.

### Hello, Event Sourcing.

At this point, I won't need to pitch Akka to you - no more threads and locks, we use Actors instead, this model is used [all](https://www.lightbend.com/case-studies) [over](https://x.com/lightbend/status/1067393653356802048?lang=en) [the](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/product-design/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont-linkedins-real-time-presence-platf) [place](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/wasdevops/viewdocument/reactive-commerce-transformation-jo-1?CommunityKey=5c4ba155-561a-4794-9883-bb0c6164e14e&tab=librarydocuments) in highly distributed systems, etc. etc. The next logical phase of the model is: how can we really adopt the "let it crash" philosophy and still keep the system up to date and not lose in-memory state?

Akka Persistence is the answer. This course is for the Scala & Akka developer who needs to make their system long-lived and fault-tolerant.

### After this course, you'll be able to:

- use Event Sourcing, a new technique for storing data
- use actors that never "truly" die
- manage actor state recovery
- use snapshots for speedy recovery
- avoid the common pitfalls while working with persistent actors
- integrate various storage systems with Akka, including Postgres and Cassandra
- write your own custom data serialization
- write robust architectures by detaching the business logic (domain) model from the data model
- think long-term about your system events with Event Adapters
- implement the CQRS pattern

### Plus some extra perks:

- You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (all 1276 lines of it)
- You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
- (soon) You'll have access to the takeaway slides
- (soon) You'll be able to download the videos for your offline view

### Skills you'll get:

- Use Event Sourcing, a new technique for storing data
  - use Persistent Actors
  - manage Persistent Actors state and recovery
  - know the difference between a Command and an Event
  - use various persisting techniques, including async persisting
  - use snapshots for quick state recovery
- Integrate production-ready stores
  - local stores with LevelDB
  - PostgreSQL
  - Cassandra
  - plus custom serialization techniques (advanced)
- Use advanced patterns and best practices
  - effectively decouple the domain model from the data model
  - use Event Adapters for the long term
  - implement the CQRS pattern with Akka Persistence Query
- Avoid crucial mistakes which can break your system
  - breaking actor encapsulation because of improper persisting
  - journal failures
  - recovery failures
  - journal corruption
  - losing snapshots
  - messing up the event order

all with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.
