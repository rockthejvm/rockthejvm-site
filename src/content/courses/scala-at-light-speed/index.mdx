  - question: Did you just say I can learn Kotlin in a couple of hours?
    answer: I did. This is my first attempt at this format. If this course works (or doesn't), I'd love to hear your feedback at rockthejvm.com/contact.

    ### I want it fast and I want it now.

    Scala is a fantastic language. It's becoming more popular and powers some of the best tools in the world for data processing, distributed computing and much more. But it's hard to learn - usually takes months to get familiar and years to fully master.

    But it doesn't need to be this way. You can learn fast with the right tools, the right selection of topics and the right sequencing so you can relate to them as you progress. This mini-course gives you that.

    **In the time it takes for you to watch a movie, you will learn the equivalent of a 300 page book and you will have the tools to read, understand and work with Scala in whatever project comes your way.**

    ### Scala is badass.

    If you got to this page, you probably know some things about Scala:

    - <p>it's based on the JVM, so you have access to every single library and framework ever built in the Java ecosystem, plus it can work with Java code in the same project</p>
    - <p> the demand for Scala has skyrocketed and companies are having a hard time filling their Scala positions</p>
    - <p>Scala devs are some of the best-paid folks in the industry: 20%, 50% or even 2x their Java equivalents</p>
    **In more than 20000 developers I've taught who are now working with Scala, and many more Scala developers that I know personally, I haven't heard ANY of them willing to go back to Java after having a taste of Scala. It's that good.**

    ### The first and only hit-and-run Scala course on the web.

    Here are some stats about the course:

    - <p>This course takes roughly 2 hours of watch time in total.</p>
    - <p>You will write roughly 500 lines of code.</p>
    - <p>You'll go through ~50 examples demonstrating concepts from very basic to pretty advanced.</p>

    Once enrolled, you have access to the course for as long as Rock the JVM is a thing. **You can watch this in an envening and get off your chair with Scala in your arsenal.** You also have a GitHub repo with all the code I wrote on camera.

    ### It's free.

    But I hope this course turns out better than most people's paid stuff.

    ### I do ask for two things.

    **First, the course needs some programming background.** I will often refer to Java, C++, C, Python or JavaScript throughout the course so you can relate to the topics and "click" them in your head faster. If you've never coded before, this course is not for you.

    **Second, I will ask for your undivided attention.** As much as you give to your SO. Seriously, this course is not rushed (I hope), but it's compressed like a neutron star, with a new thing every 1-2 minutes. It will only be as effective as your focus and commitment throughout the videos.

    **If you like this course, I have an optional ask:** share it. Give this to your colleague, your friend, your dad, your dog, your grandma. Pass this on Twitter and mention us, put it on your LinkedIn or your favorite forum or wherever you think this can help people.

    ### After this course, you'll be able to:
    - <p>understand the most complex Kotlin features</p>
    - <p>contribute to complex codebases</p>
    - <p>write libraries and tools for other developers</p>
    - <p>use the Kotlin type system for generic, easily reusable code</p>
    - <p>write frameworks that generate or analyze other source code</p>

    ### Skills you'll get:

    - <p>Kotlin type system mastery</p>
      - <p>OOP and FP (obviously)</p>
      - <p>Delegation and delegated properties</p>
      - <p>Using delegated properties in the standard library for specific contexts</p>
      - <p>Simplifying your types</p>
      - <p>Using advanced generics with variance</p>
      - <p>Understanding the compiler type-checker and variance positions</p>
    - <p>Kotlin internals proficiency</p>
      - <p>Contracts and compiler type checks</p>
      - <p>Inline functions and performance optimization</p>
      - <p>Avoiding JVM type erasure</p>
      - <p>Using reified types</p>
      - <p>Using reflection for manipulating and using code dynamically at runtime</p>
      - <p>Creating code generators and analyzers</p>
      - <p>Writing symbol processors</p>

    <p>and much more, all with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.</p>

    ### Plus some extra perks:

        - You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (1800+ LOC)
        - You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
        - You'll have access to the takeaway slides
