faqs:
  - question: Dude, did you just say I can learn Kotlin in 2 hours?
    answer: I did and I do. I also made a 2-hour Scala course a few years ago, which worked great, and Scala is even harder than Kotlin. In any case, if this course works (or doesn't), I'd like to hear from you.
  - question: How long do I have access to the course?
    answer: The online platforms call this "lifetime access". It's really up as long as Rock the JVM is alive, which I hope will be a long time.
  - question: What if I am unhappy with the course?
    answer: Your money back. Also, tell me at daniel@rockthejvm.com. I want to make this better and more effective.
  - question: Do you issue certificates?
    answer: Not for this course. Although your focus for 2 hours in this course is commendable, a certificate wouldn't mean much, because you haven't put in the work yet to solve a problem or build something. If you do build something out of your own two hands after finishing this course, let me know at daniel@rockthejvm.com and I will send you a gift as a marker of your work.
