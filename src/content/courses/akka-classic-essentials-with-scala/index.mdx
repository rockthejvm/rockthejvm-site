faqs:
  - question: My project/company uses Akka Classic. Should I learn the Typed course?
    answer: No, stick with this course. The core concepts are the same, and you can easily transition to Akka Typed when your project does.
  - question: Do you recommend Akka Typed or Classic?
    answer: I prefer strongly-typed APIs, so Akka Typed is the better choice.
  - question: How is this course different from the Akka Typed version?
    answer: This course covers similar concepts, but Akka Typed APIs differ significantly. In Akka Typed, actors are defined by their behaviors, messages require type-checking, and the code structure is somewhat different. # TODO
