excerpt: <p>Become a Akka Classic developer by mastering the essentials of Akka Classic with Scala using our comprehensive, hands-on course</p>
faqs:
  - question: My project/company uses Akka Classic. Should I learn the Typed course?
    answer: No, stick with this course. The core concepts are the same, and you can easily transition to Akka Typed when your project does.
  - question: Do you recommend Akka Typed or Classic?
    answer: I prefer strongly-typed APIs, so Akka Typed is the better choice.
  - question: How is this course different from the Akka Typed version?
    answer: This course covers similar concepts, but Akka Typed APIs differ significantly. In Akka Typed, actors are defined by their behaviors, messages require type-checking, and the code structure is somewhat different.

### The classic Akka actors course is still available.

Akka is one of the most powerful toolkits in the Scala ecosystem. Mimicking human interaction with the actor model revolutionized the way we build and think parallel and distributed applications.

Although we have [a completely revamped course with the latest Akka Typed version](/courses/akka-apache-pekko-essentials-with-scala), This course will still be alive on Rock the JVM for as long as people continue to use Akka Classic.

This course is 100% compatible with the latest fully supported Akka Classic (which at the time of writing is 2.9.x) and gives you the same benefits for the Classic API.
