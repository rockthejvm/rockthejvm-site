description: Everything you need to work with Scala, from zero to master.
excerpt: <p>Become one of the best Scala programmers. Take all of the above at a discount, where you have everything you need to work with Scala, from zero to master.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is this in total? Will I have time for it?
    answer: This series is roughly 40 hours in total, with lessons around 15-25 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focused work at one time. You can cover everything in 2 weeks if you're committed.
  - question: Does this really work?
    answer: Yes. Also, that's not my answer - it's what you hear about all the Rock the JVM material from thousands of people now working at Apple, UniCredit, Adobe, Uber and other successful companies and teams around the world.
  - question: Is it hard?
    answer: No. It just grows in difficulty in time, proportional to your work. I only require that you've programmed before in some other language and you know some general fundamentals. At the end of the series, you will look back to the advanced pieces and you'll go like "Huh. That would have been pretty tough if I tried that on my own."
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: What if I don't like it?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
  - question: I've already enrolled in some of the courses, but I want to take this bundle. Can I pay the difference?
    answer: Of course. I don't want you to pay for the same thing twice. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with a proof of all your purchases and I'll create a discount for you to offset what you paid.

    ### Think differently.

    You probably know already: Scala is one of the most powerful languages on the JVM and is behind some of the best libraries and frameworks for big data processing (Spark), distributed & fault-tolerant computing (Akka), streaming (Kafka, Akka Streams), microservices (Lagom), web apps (Play) and many others.

    Scala has seen huge demand in recent years, has some of the best-paid engineering positions, and is just plain fun. This series is for people who have some programming experience (in some other language) and want a complete and comprehensive track for learning Scala.

    This bundle contains

    - <p>200+ live runnable examples</p>
    - <p>100+ exercises with solutions</p>
    - <p>8000+ lines of code written from scratch, more than most engineers write in months</p>
    - <p>(I have exactly 8378 lines on camera, which I'll share with you 100%)</p>
    - <p>Access to a growing private community on Slack</p>
    - <p>~40 hours of HD content (soon downloadable)</p>
    - <p>(Soon) takeaway slides</p>
    - <p>All updates and additional material for free, for life</p>

    ### "Show me the path."

    If you came here thinking, "I want to learn Scala, just show me a step-by-step way to do it, and I'll follow", this is it. There's little else for me to say. More than 27000 people have taken this journey and they speak:

    *I am currently at lesson number 6, and I find the course incredible. I've tried learning scala by myself and it is not easy at all. Since lesson 1 Daniel explain things very easily and each time he says something, you see it live on code. That learning curve is getting beaten to the ground!*
    (Giacomo Z., March 23, 2020)

    There are >4000 reviews like that, and that's on Udemy. The version you're looking at is even better and with exclusive new material.

    This path is literally what you need to follow to be good at Scala.
