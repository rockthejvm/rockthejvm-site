description: Everything you need to become an expert Scala developer. Master Scala and functional programming through clear lessons, practical exercises, and a smooth learning curve. Ideal for those with some programming experience, this bundle will take you from zero to hero.
excerpt: "<p>Become a Scala and functional programming expert <strong>from scratch</strong> with our <strong>all-inclusive course bundle</strong>: master everything you need in one complete package, at a discount</p>"
# faqs:
#   - question: Does this really work?
# answer: Yes. Also, that's not my answer - it's what you hear about all the Rock the JVM material from thousands of people now working at Apple, UniCredit, Adobe, Uber and other successful companies and teams around the world.
#   - question: Is it hard?
# answer: No. It just grows in difficulty in time, proportional to your work. I only require that you've programmed before in some other language and you know some general fundamentals. At the end of the series, you will look back to the advanced pieces and you'll go like "Huh. That would have been pretty tough if I tried that on my own."

    ### Think differently.

    You probably know already: Scala is one of the most powerful languages on the JVM and is behind some of the best libraries and frameworks for big data processing (Spark), distributed & fault-tolerant computing (Akka), streaming (Kafka, Akka Streams), microservices (Lagom), web apps (Play) and many others.

    Scala has seen huge demand in recent years, has some of the best-paid engineering positions, and is just plain fun. This series is for people who have some programming experience (in some other language) and want a complete and comprehensive track for learning Scala.

    This bundle contains

    - 200+ live runnable examples
    - 100+ exercises with solutions
    - 8000+ lines of code written from scratch, more than most engineers write in months
    - (I have exactly 8378 lines on camera, which I'll share with you 100%)
    - Access to a growing private community on Slack
    - ~40 hours of HD content (soon downloadable)
    - (Soon) takeaway slides
    - All updates and additional material for free, for life

    ### "Show me the path."

    If you came here thinking, "I want to learn Scala, just show me a step-by-step way to do it, and I'll follow", this is it. There's little else for me to say. More than 27000 people have taken this journey and they speak:

    *I am currently at lesson number 6, and I find the course incredible. I've tried learning scala by myself and it is not easy at all. Since lesson 1 Daniel explain things very easily and each time he says something, you see it live on code. That learning curve is getting beaten to the ground!*
    (Giacomo Z., March 23, 2020)

    There are >4000 reviews like that, and that's on Udemy. The version you're looking at is even better and with exclusive new material.

    This path is literally what you need to follow to be good at Scala.
