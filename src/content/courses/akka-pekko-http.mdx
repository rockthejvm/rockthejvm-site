description: Learn Akka HTTP in this training course for Scala developers. Write reactive, stream-based microservices, REST APIs and backends.
excerpt: <p>Build <strong>microservices in minutes</strong>. Write stream-based REST APIs, backends and microservices, send and receive JSON auto-magically, all with a powerful server DSL.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is ~13 hours in length, with lectures around 20 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focused learning at one time.
  - question: How is a usual lesson like?
    answer: Code is king, and we write it from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts, either briefly on a diagram or directly in the code. We then run live examples, and usually I'll finish the lesson with some exercises, which I then solve on camera after you've tried them yourself.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is the course hard?
    answer: Not if you've done Scala and some Akka Streams before. I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: I've never written Scala before. Can I take this course?
    answer: You shouldn't. The course is for Scala programmers. Even though we do a bit of a recap at the beginning of the course to make sure we're all on the same page, that part is not enough to give you confident skills with Scala if you've never seen it before.
  - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and need to spin up REST services easily. Should I take this course?
    answer: Yes! This course is for you.
  - question: Daniel, I want to join but I can't afford it.
    answer: "For a while, I offered discounts for the Rock the JVM courses to whomever needed them. But then I looked at the stats: almost nobody who took them actually completed any course. The full-price students were 3x as likely to complete the course. So I'm not offering discounts anymore. This course will pay off if you commit. "
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
  - question: Does this work with Akka HTTP or Pekko HTTP?
    answer: Both! The course was originally recorded for Akka, but the code is almost identical for Pekko and I give detailed instructions for the (minimal) differences.
