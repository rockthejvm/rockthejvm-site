description: Everything you need to become an expert Apache Spark developer. Master Spark with Scala and big data through clear lessons, practical exercises, and a smooth learning curve. Ideal for those with some programming experience, this bundle will take you from zero to hero.
excerpt: "<p>Become a Apache Spark and big data expert <strong>from scratch</strong> with our <strong>all-inclusive course bundle</strong>: master everything you need using Scala in one complete package, at a discount</p>"
# faqs:
#   - question: Does this really work?
# answer: Yes. Also, that's not my answer - it's what you hear about all the Rock the JVM material from thousands of people now working at Apple, UniCredit, Adobe, Uber and other successful companies and teams around the world.
#   - question: Is it hard?
# answer: No. It just grows in difficulty in time, proportional to your work. I only require that you've programmed before in some other language and you know some general fundamentals. At the end of the series, you will look back to the advanced pieces and you'll go like "Huh. That would have been pretty tough if I tried that on my own."

### Crunch that data.

You probably know already: Spark is one of the most powerful big data crunching tools, one of the most extensible and well maintained, [one of the most loved](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-other-frameworks-libraries-and-tools), and used by thousands of developers, teams, companies and organizations. It's 100x faster than the previous Map-Reduce paradigm, and it just works.

Spark has seen huge demand in recent years, has [some of the best-paid engineering positions](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=Apache_Spark/Salary), and is just plain fun. This series is for Scala programmers who need to crunch big data with Spark, and need a clear path to mastering it.

This bundle contains

- <p>100+ live runnable examples</p>
- <p>100+ exercises with solutions</p>
- <p>
    3 real-life projects crunching either one the largest public datasets
    available, or live data in real time
  </p>
- <p>
    4000+ lines of code written from scratch, more than most engineers write in
    months
  </p>
- <p>(I have exactly 4109 lines on camera, which I'll share with you 100%)</p>
- <p>Access to a growing private community on Slack</p>
- <p>~25 hours of HD content (soon downloadable)</p>
- <p>(Soon) takeaway slides</p>
- <p>All updates and additional material for free, for life</p>

### "Show me the path."

If you came here thinking, "I want to learn Spark, just show me a step-by-step way to do it, and I'll follow", this is it. There's little else for me to say. More than 2000 people have taken this journey and they speak:

_This is the connecting dots video series for get over all concepts of Spark process which is extremely useful for the peoples just started learning spark. Thank you Daniel_
(Anoop C., March 11, 2020)

There are hundreds of reviews like that, and that's on Udemy. The version you're looking at is even better and with exclusive new material. **You will crunch BILLIONS of records on an Amazon cluster, do sentiment analysis on live Twitter data, integrate Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Akka Streams, and whatever your heart desires.**

This path is literally what you need to follow to be good at Spark.

### After completing this Spark masterclass, you'll be equipped to:
- Work with Apache Spark in projects of any size and complexity
- Process data of any size
- Deploy Spark applications on clusters of any size
- Optimize Spark jobs for ultimate performance
- Optimize Spark _clusters_ for minimal resource usage
- Lead other data engineers on Spark best practice
- Understand Spark at a deep level
- Work with batch and streaming jobs equally well

Many of the ideas from these courses - especially the Spark optimization courses - have saved millions of dollars in cloud costs for many companies. You can have these skills for a fraction of the cost of a corporate training package.

### Apache Spark features we cover:

- Spark basics
  - how Spark parallelizes data processing
  - transformations and actions

  - joins
  - grouping
- Spark types
  - schemas
  - handling nulls
  - complex and structured types
  - type-safe Datasets in Scala
- Spark SQL
- RDDs
- Operational Spark
  - how Spark runs on a cluster
  - understanding jobs
  - navigating the Spark UI
  - logging and debugging
- Spark Structured streaming
  - micro-batching
  - streaming DataFrames
  - transformation restrictions
  - stream-native processing
  - stateful stream processing
  - time-based transformations
- Spark integrations with data sources and sinks
- Spark optimization
  - understanding narrow/wide transformations
  - tradeoffs between DataFrames and RDDs
  - predicting performance
  - query plans
  - reading and understanding DAGs
- Performance optimization techniques
  - optimizing joins
  - broadcast joins
  - bucketing and partitioning
  - data pruning
  - fixing data skews
- Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)
- Low-level Spark optimization
  - co-grouping
  - RDD optimizations
  - iterator-to-iterator transformations
- Spark performance tuning
  - understanding and configuring Spark internals
  - caching
  - checkpointing
  - memory and CPU tuning
  - partition tuning
  - cluster resource allocation
  - tuning serialization

In short, everything you need to become an Apache Spark master.

### Additional perks:

- Full access to all the code written during the courses
- Full access to the data we use during the projects
- Invitation to join a private Slack community, where you'll get exclusive updates, opportunities, and discussions
- Access to all slides for easy reference
- Free updates and expansions, no expiration date
