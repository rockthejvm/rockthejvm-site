description: Learn advanced Spark performance tuning for ultimate speed. Master Spark internals and configurations to maximize the efficiency of your cluster.
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is almost 8 hours in length, with lessons usually 20-30 minutes each, and we write 1000-1500 lines of code. That’s because to learn strategies to boost Spark’s performance, 5-minute lectures or fill-in-the-blanks quizzes won’t give you the necessary results. For the best effectiveness, it’s advised to watch the video lectures in 1-hour chunks at a time.
  - question: What does a typical lesson contain?
    answer: Code is king, and we write from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts in short, then I'll dive right into the code. We'll write it together, either in the IDE or in the Spark Shell, and we test the effects of the code on either pre-loaded data (which I provide) or with bigger, generated data (whose generator I also provide). Sometimes we'll spend some time in the Spark UI to understand what's going on. A few lectures are atypical in that we're going to go through some thought exercises, but they're no less powerful.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: A wise company will spend some money on training their folks here rather than spending thousands (or millions) on computing power for nothing.
  - question: Is this hard?
    answer: There's a reason not everyone is a Spark pro. However, my job is to give you these (otherwise hard) topics in a way that will make you go like "huh, that wasn't so hard".
  - question: What if I'm not happy with the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: Daniel, I can't afford the course. What do I do?
    answer: For a while, I told everyone who could not afford a course to email me and I gave them discounts. But then I looked at the stats. Almost ALL the people who actually took the time and completed the course had paid for it in full. So I'm not offering discounts anymore. This is an investment in yourself, which will pay off 100x if you commit. If you find it didn't match your investment, I'll give you a refund.
  - question: I have very little Scala or Spark experience. Can I take this course?
    answer: "Short answer: no. Long answer: we have two recap lessons at the beginning, but they're not a crash course into Scala or Spark and they're not enough if this is the first time you're seeing them. You should take the Scala beginners course and the Spark Essentials course at least. I'll also recommend taking the first Spark Optimization course, but it's not a requirement - this course is standalone. "
  - question: Why should I need to tune Spark?
    answer: Spark comes with a lot of performance tradeoffs that you will have to make while running your jobs. It's important to know what they are and how you can use each configuration or setting, so that you can get the best performance out of your jobs.
  - question: What is Spark performance tuning anyway?
    answer: To get the optimal memory usage and speed out of your Spark job, you will need to know how Spark works. Tuning Spark means setting the right configurations before running a job, the right resource allocation for your clusters, the right partitioning for your data, and many other aspects.
