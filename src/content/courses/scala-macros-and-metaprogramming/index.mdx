excerpt: <p>This course will make you write macros and metaprogramming. AKA TODO</p>
faqs:
  - question: Macros look difficult. Do I need to be a genius and have 100 years of programming experience to take this course?
    answer: This looks like magic, but it's really not harder to learn than Scala itself. All you need is half-decent programming skills and be comfortable with Scala.
