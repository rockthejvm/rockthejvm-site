description: Learn Cats Effect 3 in this online course for Scala developers.
excerpt: <p>Write composable, high-performance, purely functional applications and become productive with Cats Effect, one of the most powerful libraries for Scala.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is the Cats Effect course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is a whole 15 hours in length, and we write 3000 lines of code from scratch. I recommend going through the course in sessions of at least 30 minutes each.
  - question: What does a typical lesson contain?
    answer: The course is hands-on, so most of the time will be spent writing code. I'll guide you every step of the way, explaining what each bit means. We'll also have some theoretical sections in the lessons as appropriate.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enroll, you'll automatically get an invoice which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: Is Cats Effect hard?
    answer: Usually. The learning curve is steep if you're doing it on your own. That's why I made this course, to compress your learning time to just a couple of days, with a smooth progression and lots of practice.
  - question: What if I'm not happy with the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: Daniel, I can't afford the course. What do I do?
    answer: Check out the membership. It gives you access to everything on the site at an affordable price, and you'll be done with the course no problem.
  - question: I'm just getting started with Scala. Can I take this course?
    answer: "Short answer: probably not. Longer answer: we have some Scala starter code at the beginning of the course, but that won't replace the kind of experience we need for this course. I recommend you check out the Scala essentials and advanced courses first before coming back here."
