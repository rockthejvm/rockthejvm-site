faqs:
  - question: Is Scala 2 outdated?
    answer: Not yet &ndash; Scala 2 remains widely used, and transitioning to Scala 3 will take time. Additionally, most features you'll learn in this course are still relevant to Scala 3.
  - question: How is this course different from the Scala 3 version?
    answer: Scala 3 introduces many new features and changes not present in Scala 2. The Scala 3 version also includes improved explanations of complex topics, new exercises, a smoother learning curve, and more code.
#   - question: I'm just starting with Scala. Which course should I take, this one or the Scala 3 version?
# answer: Choose the Scala 3 version. It's superior in almost every way and covers the latest Scala features. Scala 2 is only worth learning if your project or job requires it, but transitioning to Scala 3 is straightforward.
#   - question: Is this course hard?
#     answer: I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.

### The course that started Rock the JVM is still live..

Scala is one of the most powerful programming languages invented by humankind. This course taught 35000+ engineers, now working at the biggest companies in the world.

Although we have [a completely revamped course specifically for Scala 3](/courses/scala-essentials), This course will still be alive on Rock the JVM for as long as people continue to use the old Scala 2. It's only fair - this course started Rock the JVM as a project.

This course is 100% compatible with the latest fully supported Scala 2 version (currently 2.13), and contains all the features of the Scala 3 version of the course:

- Timeless Scala skills, on any version
- Object Orientation
- Functional Programming
- Pattern Matching

and gives you the same perks:

- Full code I write on camera (2000+ LOC)
- Exclusive access our private Slack group
- Takeaway slides
- All updates free
- Never expires
