excerpt: <p>The popular Scala course that taught 35000+ engineers, still available for Scala 2.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How is this course different than the Scala 3 version?
    answer: Scala 3 has a number of features that Scala 2 doesn't have; a lot of things changed. Also, the Scala 3 version has many improvements on how I explain complex topics, new exercises, a smoother learning curve and more code.
  - question: I'm just starting with Scala. Which course should I take, this one or the one with Scala 3?
    answer: Take the Scala 3 version. It's better by almost all metrics and you'll learn the latest Scala too.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is the course hard?
    answer: I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.

    ### The course that started Rock the JVM is still live..

    Scala is one of the most powerful programming languages invented by humankind. This course taught 35000+ engineers, now working at the biggest companies in the world.

    Although we have [a completely revamped course specifically for Scala 3](https://rockthejvm.com/p/scala), This course will still be alive on Rock the JVM for as long as people continue to use the old Scala 2. It's only fair - this course started Rock the JVM as a project.

    This course is 100% compatible with the latest fully supported Scala 2 version (currently 2.13), and contains all the features of the Scala 3 version of the course:
    - Timeless Scala skills, on any version
    - Object Orientation
    - Functional Programming
    - Pattern Matching

    and gives you the same perks:
    - Full code I write on camera (2000+ LOC)
    - Exclusive access our private Slack group
    - Takeaway slides
    - All updates free
    - Never expires
