excerpt: <p><strong>Stream big data like a boss.</strong> Process millions of events in real time with one of the most powerful libraries and engines for stateful data streaming.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is the Flink course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is a whole 8 hours in length, and we write 2000 lines of code from scratch. I recommend going through the course in sessions of at least 30 minutes each.
  - question: What does a typical lesson contain?
    answer: The course is hands-on. We'll mostly write code, and I'll guide you all along. We also have some theoretical sections, but those tend to be short and visual, then we get back straight to the code.
  - question: Can I expense this course at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enrol, you'll automatically get an invoice which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: Is Flink hard to learn?
    answer: Flink is notorious for its steep learning curve. Even for the smallest application, you'll need a lot of concepts at the same time. This Flink course deconstructs Flink and isolates its parts so that you can learn step by step.
  - question: What if I'm not happy with the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: Daniel, I can't afford the course. What do I do?
    answer: Check out the membership. It gives you access to everything on the site at an affordable price, and you'll be done with the course no problem.
  - question: I'm just getting started with Scala. Can I take this course?
    answer: "Short answer: probably not. Longer answer: we have some Scala starter code at the beginning of the course, but that won't replace the kind of experience we need for this course. We aren't using any Scala rocket science, but you need to be comfortable with it. I recommend you check out the Scala essentials and advanced courses first before coming back here."
  - question: I hate ___ and wish to email you about it
    answer: Plz no :D
