description: Everything you need to know for Scala with Cats. Think at a higher level, write grounded code.
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is a big 12 hours in length, with lessons 20-30 minutes each, and we write 2000+ lines of code. For a complex topic as Cats, I don't believe in 5-minute lectures or in fill-in-the-blanks quizzes. For best effectiveness, I recommend chunks of 1 hour of learning at a time. Note that 12 hours is just the total video time. If you put in the effort to do the exercises yourself (which I warmly recommend), the total time spent here can go to 20h+. Even so, it's 10x less than you would need if you learned by yourself.
  - question: What does a typical lesson contain?
    answer: Code is king, and we write from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts in short, then I'll dive right into the code. We write code most of the time, while explaining WHY each thing happens.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enroll, you'll automatically get an invoice which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: Is this hard?
    answer: This, meaning Cats? Yes. This course? Not if you follow it closely and doing all the exercises. I've designed this as a smooth learning curve.
  - question: What if I'm not happy with the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: Daniel, I can't afford the course. What do I do?
    answer: I used to offer discounts, but I'm not anymore because almost nobody who took a discount actually completed a course, and I'd rather not have your money if you're not committed. The cheapest option for you would be to get the membership (which gives you access to all the other courses here) and then cancel when you're done.
  - question: I'm just getting started with Scala. Can I take this course?
    answer: "Short answer: probably not. Longer answer: we have some Scala starter code at the beginning of the course, but that's really not a replacement for the kind of experience we need in this course. We really need you to be comfortable with advanced language constructs - Cats is difficult enough as it is."
