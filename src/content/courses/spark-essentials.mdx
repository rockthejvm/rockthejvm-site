description: Learn Apache Spark with Scala in this online course for beginners. This is the only Big Data online course on the web with ACTUAL big data.
excerpt: <p>The only Big Data course on the web with <strong>real</strong> big data. Learn the most popular big data toolkit while crunching billions of records, live, in record time.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is a full 10 hours in length, with lessons 20-30 minutes each. For a complex topic as Spark, I don't believe in 5-minute lectures as I don't believe in fill-in-the-blanks quizzes. For best effectiveness, I recommend chunks of 1 hour of learning at a time.
  - question: What does a typical lesson contain?
    answer: Code is king, and we write from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts in short, then I'll dive right into the code. We'll write it together, and at every topic I will give you exercises. You'll usually pause the video to try them yourself, after which I will also solve them on camera.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Yes, you can! Most (wise) companies will reimburse employees taking courses like this.
  - question: Is Spark hard to learn?
    answer: It can be, if you're trying to learn on your own, which is why I've created this dedicated Spark course. The course was designed to give you a challenge so you're not bored, but not so much that you flip the table in anger. In case you struggle, we have a community willing to help, and I'm responsive for questions!
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: Daniel, I really want to join but I can't afford the course.
    answer: For a while, I told everyone who could not afford the course to email me and I gave them discounts. But then I looked at the stats. Almost all the people who actually took the time and completed the course had paid for it in full. So I'm not offering discounts anymore. This is an investment in yourself, which will pay off 100x if you commit.
  - question: I'm an advanced user of Spark with Scala. Should I take this course?
    answer: Probably not, unless you want a structured refresher.
  - question: I have very little experience with Scala (if any). Should I take this course?
    answer: I don't recommend it. You should take the Scala beginners course (at least) first, before you learn Spark.

    ### Become a professional.

    You probably know by now: Spark is the most popular computing engine for big data, the most maintained, and with a proven track record of performance. It's 100 times faster than the old MapReduce paradigm, and can easily be extended with machine learning and streaming capabilities, and much more.

    If you're dealing with large amounts of data, learning Spark is a must.

    The demand for Spark has skyrocketed, and companies are struggling to fill their Data Scientist positions. Scala and Spark are two of the best paying technologies in the field. Forget the reported 120k salaries on PayScale and StackOverflow. I regularly see engineers and data scientists working for 150k+ per year, or charging thousands a day for consulting.

    However you take it, learning Spark will be a game changer for your career, if you choose. And this course will help you get those skills. Join this Spark Big Data online course and learn by writing code.

    ### Work with real big data.

    At the end of the course, we will dive into one of the biggest datasets publicly available and we'll put everything that we've learned to the test. Unlike every other material on the web (free or paid), this Spark course is the only place where you can really practice big data.

    Everyone else runs a Spark job on one million records in a 20MB dataset. Why would you need Spark for that?

    We do 1.4 BILLION car trips in a 400GB dataset. You don't fit that into most computers. That's the definition of big data.

    This will be your true exercise to practice Spark with Scala. At the end of the project, we gather data insights worth millions of dollars for the company you're looking to help, and tens of thousands for you as a consultant and data scientist.

    ### Take the proven path

    As with the other Rock the JVM courses, this Spark and Big Data Essentials course will take you through a battle-tested path to Spark proficiency as a data scientist and engineer.

    As always, I've

    - <p>Deconstructed the complexity of Spark in bite-sized chunks that you can practice in isolation</p>
    - <p>Selected the essential concepts and exercises with the appropriate complexity</p>
    - <p>Sequenced the topics in increasing order of difficulty so that they "click" along the way</p>
    - <p>Applied everything in live code</p>
