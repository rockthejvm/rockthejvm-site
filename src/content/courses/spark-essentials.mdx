description: Learn Apache Spark with Scala in this online course for beginners. This is the only Big Data online course on the web with ACTUAL big data.
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is a full 10 hours in length, with lessons 20-30 minutes each. For a complex topic as Spark, I don't believe in 5-minute lectures as I don't believe in fill-in-the-blanks quizzes. For best effectiveness, I recommend chunks of 1 hour of learning at a time.
  - question: What does a typical lesson contain?
    answer: Code is king, and we write from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts in short, then I'll dive right into the code. We'll write it together, and at every topic I will give you exercises. You'll usually pause the video to try them yourself, after which I will also solve them on camera.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Yes, you can! Most (wise) companies will reimburse employees taking courses like this.
  - question: Is Spark hard to learn?
    answer: It can be, if you're trying to learn on your own, which is why I've created this dedicated Spark course. The course was designed to give you a challenge so you're not bored, but not so much that you flip the table in anger. In case you struggle, we have a community willing to help, and I'm responsive for questions!
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: Daniel, I really want to join but I can't afford the course.
    answer: For a while, I told everyone who could not afford the course to email me and I gave them discounts. But then I looked at the stats. Almost all the people who actually took the time and completed the course had paid for it in full. So I'm not offering discounts anymore. This is an investment in yourself, which will pay off 100x if you commit.
  - question: I'm an advanced user of Spark with Scala. Should I take this course?
    answer: Probably not, unless you want a structured refresher.
  - question: I have very little experience with Scala (if any). Should I take this course?
    answer: I don't recommend it. You should take the Scala beginners course (at least) first, before you learn Spark.
