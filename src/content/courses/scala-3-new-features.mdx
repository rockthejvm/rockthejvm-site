excerpt: <p>Learn Scala 3 new features without learning the language all over again. A short course for Scala 2 developers.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How much time do I need to learn Scala 3?
    answer: If you want to learn on your own, you can learn Scala 3 from various blog posts, the Scala documentation website, Scala books or videos online. Between searching, reading everything, making all the connections, practicing the new features on your own code and applying what you've learned, it usually takes a few dozen hours. I want to help you get everything you need in 4 hours.
  - question: Is Scala 3 hard to learn?
    answer: Not at all, in fact it's quite easier to get started with Scala 3 than Scala 2 if you're a beginner. If you're a Scala developer already, learning Scala 3 is not difficult, it just takes time. That said, there are some Scala 3 new features that are hard (e.g. type lambdas) even for existing Scala developers. We'll cover everything in this course with easy examples.
  - question: Why should I upgrade to Scala 3?
    answer: Scala 3 introduced some changes that make a developer's life much easier. Scala 3 also changed compiler internals so that it has backward compatibility, which is a first for the Scala language. Going forward, it's going to be much easier to upgrade to the latest Scala version. The compiler is also faster, and the language itself is more expressive.
  - question: What is the difference between Scala 2 and Scala 3?
    answer: Scala 3 introduced a bunch of language features like enums, extension methods, new context abstractions, type lambdas and a lot of niceties that make our life easier. The compiler is also different, faster and with backward compatibility between Scala 3 versions.
  - question: Is Scala 3 production ready?
    answer: Yes!
  - question: Does Spark support Scala 3?
    answer: At the time of writing (May 2022) it's been supporting Scala 2.13 for almost a year. Scala 3 is backwards compatible with 2.13, so it's only a matter of time before they upgrade.
  - question: Does ___ support Scala 3?
    answer: More and more libraries and tools are being upgraded to Scala 3. Most Typelevel libraries (Cats, Cats Effect, etc) already support it, ZIO 2.0 supports it out of the box, and Akka is due to release Scala 3-native artifacts soon (writing this in May 2022).
  - question: Does the course include migration strategies?
    answer: No. This course contains everything changed with the Scala language and runtime. In my experience, a migration is almost always a very particular journey for every project. So if I show you some patterns and tips, they may not apply to you exactly, and the common patterns are too simple and would have bloated this course. The goal of the course is to be short, sweet and focused on writing Scala, so I decided not to include them. Feedback welcome at daniel@rockthejvm.com!
  - question: Does the course include the new Scala 3 metaprogramming?
    answer: Scala 3 metaprogramming deserves its own course - will come soon in the form of some "black magic" Scala course.
  - question: How is this course different from the other Scala 3 courses on Rock the JVM?
    answer: This course is focused just on the Scala 2 -> Scala 3 changes. If you're a Scala dev already, you don't need me to tell you the basics again. The Scala Essentials + Advanced courses are 40 hours in total! This course is just 4 hours long. Take this one, and you'll be well on your way.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.

    ### Become a Kotlin pro.

    If you're on this page, Kotlin will need no introduction. You know the basics, and you've written your fair share of Kotlin in production for your projects, either personal or at work.

    Perhaps your codebase has become larger than you can manage, or you would like to become a senior developer, or need to write libraries and tools for other team members.

    For this, you need **deep knowledge** of Kotlin's type system and internals, so that you can create the best tools.

    **This course is for you.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="question">
    ### Oh yeah.
    You already know that Kotlin is such a game changer. It's very pragmatic, very flexible, has a powerful compiler, and allows you to write concise code that's easy for other people to understand.

    But there's far more to it.

    Beyond essentials OOP or functional principles, Kotlin has features that few developers have mastered. Kotlin's type system is among the best on the JVM, and the tools to manipulate types and code at runtime are top notch.

    With these tools, you can write **libraries, tools for other developers, frameworks for large codebases**, and much more.

    This is what you'll learn in this advanced Kotlin course.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature1">
    ### Who is this course is for?
    This course is best for **Kotlin developers who need to deeply understand the internals of Kotlin** and use its type system to write complex applications, libraries, tools, code generators or analyzers.

    **If you're a Kotlin developer looking to become senior, this course is for you.**

    If this is your first time with Kotlin, the [Kotlin Essentials](/courses/kotlin-essentials) course is your best starting point.

    And rest assured - if you buy this course and find that it's not for you, you'll get your money back anytime ðŸ’°.

    This course is 100% hands-on - this picture shows the code we write in this course.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature2">
    ### Platform Agnostic
    Many people learn Kotlin to build Android apps. Like the [Kotlin Essentials course](/courses/kotlin-essentials), **this advanced course does <ins>not</ins> focus on Android**, but on Kotlin itself.

    The skills you get in this course will allow you to build **complex systems, libraries and tools for other developers**. Notice that this applies to Android, the JVM, native code, KotlinJS, or anything else - **this course transcends any platform!**

    If you are specifically looking for an Android course, this course is still useful because after you finish this course, you can study the Android specifics without thinking too much about Kotlin - because by this time it will be second nature to you.

    **Regardless of what your goal is, this Kotlin course will help you no matter where you deploy your code.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature3">
    ### 100% Practical
    As always, **code is king, and we write it from scratch.**

    We don't waste time on endless theory, and I only use a few slides every lesson as "flashcards" you can come back to. You'll also get the slides in PDF for easy recall.

    Besides the dozens of examples that demonstrate the most complex Kotlin features, we spend a lot of time in **real-life exercises**, where we try to write (at small scale) the same kind of tools you'd be in charge of at work.

    The picture you see here is a mini-library we write in the course for HTML rendering with a nice DSL.

    In the process, you'll get hands-on experience not only with the hard Kotlin features, but you'll get a sense of **what it's like to write complex code** for other people.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="skills">
    ### After this course, you'll be able to:
    - <p>understand the most complex Kotlin features</p>
    - <p>contribute to complex codebases</p>
    - <p>write libraries and tools for other developers</p>
    - <p>use the Kotlin type system for generic, easily reusable code</p>
    - <p>write frameworks that generate or analyze other source code</p>

    ### Skills you'll get:
