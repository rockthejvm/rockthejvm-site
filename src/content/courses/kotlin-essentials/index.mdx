# faqs:
#   - question: I'm an advanced Kotlin user. Should I take this course?
# answer: Probably not. The advanced course might be better for you.
#   - question: Is this Kotlin course hard?
#     answer: Not really. If you have some existing experience coding in another language, this course should be relaxing enough to have fun, but will give you a nice brain stretch. If you haven't programmed before, the course might be a bit tougher, simply because we skip the CS fundamentals. But don't stress about it! Ask in our private community if you ever get stuck, and we'll help.

    ### New thinking tools

    It's time to learn Kotlin, a mega-powerful language with open doors to different platforms: desktop, mobile, web, and even all at once in the same project.

    I made this course to give you essential Kotlin programming skills that will quickly get you active in any Kotlin project. You'll get solid practice in Kotlin's fundamentals, and syntax is the smallest part. With **100+ practical examples and exercises inspired from real-life experience,** you'll not only get the foundations right but some **2500+ lines of code** under your belt.

    And code is one thing, but this course has a deeper purpose: to teach you to **think differently.**

    As we progress through the course, you'll see that your mental model will start to change, and you'll write **more compact and powerful code, faster.** By the end of the course, you'll have your first application ready to build, deploy and ship, and I use it on my own pictures, on camera.

  <Fragment slot="question">
    Kotlin is a language designed to make programming simpler, faster, and way more fun - clean, concise code that's a breeze to read and write, leaving behind the headaches of verbose syntax or obscure primitives.

    It's a game-changer.

    With Kotlin, you can create apps for Android, applications for the web, for the server-side, or multiplatform with shared code. You rarely get a more powerful combo. Kotlin also plays nice with Java and the massive JVM ecosystem, so you have access to a giant amount of battle-tested code for your projects.

    But the real kicker is this: Kotlin gives you a mental framework that works well in just about any environment, whether you're using low-level code for hyper-optimizations, or high-level code and functional programming for fast productivity.

    ### Who is this course for?
    **Software engineers or students with some experience with at least another programming language.** The language is not really important - what matters in this course is the mental model, and I'll draw many similarities and differences with other programming langauges, including Java, Scala, the C family, Python, JavaScript, and others.

    **If this is the first time you're learning to code,** you should do just fine in this course, but the pace might be a bit quick because I don't cover the general computer science fundamentals.

    Really, **anyone looking to learn Kotlin hands-on** is welcome in this course, and you'll get a solid 2500 lines of code in this course and your first Kotlin JVM application ready to use, among a hundred other examples and exercises.

    Not sure if it's for you? Money back if it's not a fit 💰

    **This screenshot shows you the code that we'll write together.

    ### Platform Agnostic
    Many people learn Kotlin to build Android apps. Like the [Kotlin Essentials course](/courses/kotlin-essentials), **this advanced course does <ins>not</ins> focus on Android**, but on Kotlin itself.

    The skills you get in this course will allow you to build **complex systems, libraries and tools for other developers**. Notice that this applies to Android, the JVM, native code, KotlinJS, or anything else - **this course transcends any platform!**

    If you are specifically looking for an Android course, this course is still useful because after you finish this course, you can study the Android specifics without thinking too much about Kotlin - because by this time it will be second nature to you.

    **Regardless of what your goal is, this Kotlin course will help you no matter where you deploy your code.**

    ### 100% Practical
    As always, **code is king, and we write it from scratch.**

    We don't waste time on endless theory, and I only use a few slides every lesson as "flashcards" you can come back to. You'll also get the slides in PDF for easy recall.

    Besides the dozens of examples that demonstrate the most complex Kotlin features, we spend a lot of time in **real-life exercises**, where we try to write (at small scale) the same kind of tools you'd be in charge of at work.

    The picture you see here is a mini-library we write in the course for HTML rendering with a nice DSL.

    In the process, you'll get hands-on experience not only with the hard Kotlin features, but you'll get a sense of **what it's like to write complex code** for other people.

    ### After this course, you'll be able to:
    - Understand Kotlin in production environments and in most projects
    - Start contributing to Kotlin projects in minutes instead of days
    - Write applications for any target, including Android, server, web and multiplatform
    - Learn advanced Kotlin tools and libraries very quickly
    - Write more reliable and compact code, faster

    ### Skills you'll get:

    - Lasting comfort with the Kotlin language
      - syntax (of course, LOL)
      - types and type inference
      - expressions vs instructions
      - control structures and how they differ from other languages
      - string templating
    - Extended object-oriented concepts
      - classes, instances, constructors, properties, methods, the usual
      - nullables
      - new method notations for expressive code
      - extension methods
      - operator overloading
      - the singleton pattern in one line of code
      - inheritance
      - abstract classes and interfaces
      - generics
      - exception handling
      - delegation
      - anonymous classes
      - value classes
      - enums
    - Functional programming
      - using functions as values
      - anonymous functions (lambdas)
      - higher-order functions
      - collections and their "standard" and functional APIs
      - single-abstract-method patterns (SAM)

    and much more, all with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.

    Besides these, maybe some image processing fundamentals you may not have known about 🎇 because you are going to write them! 🤯

    **Plus some extra perks:**
    - You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (2500+ LOC)
    - You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
    - You'll have access to the takeaway slides
