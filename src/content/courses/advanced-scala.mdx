description: The ultimate Scala 3 online course for advanced software engineers. Master Scala 3, functional programming, multithreading and Scala's unparalleled type system.
excerpt: <p><strong>Now with Scala 3.</strong> Become a true Scala rockstar. Master multithreading, abstractions, advanced functional programming and more. <a href="/courses/advanced-scala-old">Also available for Scala 2.</a></p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is ~20 hours in length, with lectures 15-30 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focussed learning at one time.
  - question: How is a typical lesson like?
    answer: Code is king, and we write it from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts, either briefly on a diagram or directly in the code. We then run live examples, and usually I'll finish the lesson with some exercises, which I then solve on camera after you've tried them yourself.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is the course hard?
    answer: Not if you've taken the beginners course or you have at least a year of Scala experience. I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
  - question: I've just started with Scala. Should I take this course?
    answer: I won't recommend it - the concepts here will probably crush you if you don't have a solid foundation. Take a look at the beginners course, or come back here once you have at least a year of Scala experience.
  - question: I'm an advanced Scala user. Should I take this course?
    answer: Even if I don't know your exact experience, I'm willing to bet there are at least a few things here that will leave you "huh, I didn't know that.".
  - question: How is this different from the Udemy Advanced Scala course?
    answer: This course is a COMPLETE revamp of the course which you can see on Udemy. This premium version has more content (20h > 13h), new lessons, better exercises and more code (3.5k > 2k), with a much smoother learning experience. It's also specifically built for Scala 3, which is particularly important at this level.

    ### Become a Scala pro.

    At this point, I don't need to pitch Scala to you. You've seen it in action, you know the basics, and I'm willing to bet you like it at least a bit.

    Perhaps you want to contribute to a bigger project, or need to write your own libraries at work so you can reuse them for a large system. Maybe you need to dive deep into a complex codebase or into a massive framework like Akka or Spark, but the internal code looks overwhelming.

    This course is for you. The course is for the Scala programmer who understands the essentials and wants to level up.

    **Now on Scala 3.**

    ### After this course, you'll be able to:
    - <p>Read any Scala code in any codebase, in any project, no matter how big, difficult or obscure</p>
    - <p>Contribute to any Scala project of any scale</p>
    - <p>Confidently write your own Scala libraries</p>
    - <p>Easily browse through the implementations of existing libraries without confusion</p>

      - <p>Type classes</p>
      - <p>Higher-order functions with context-based values</p>
      - <p>Implicit conversions</p>
      - <p>Implicits, i.e. the Scala 2 contextual abstractions to be fully bulletproof</p>
    - <p>Mastering the Scala type system</p>
      - <p>Deeply understanding why Scala multi-inheritance is solid</p>
      - <p>Correctly applying variance (which 99% of Scala programmers can't... because they don't understand it)</p>
      - <p>Applying self types and the layered "cake" pattern</p>
      - <p>Using higher-kinded types for generic libraries</p>
      - <p>Imposing type restrictions with recursive types and the academically-fancy-but-common-sense F-bounded polymorphism</p>

    All with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.

    ### Plus some extra perks:
    - <p>You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (all 3500+ LOC, more than most people ship in months)</p>
