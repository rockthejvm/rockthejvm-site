description: The ultimate Scala 3 online course for advanced software engineers. Master Scala 3, functional programming, multithreading and Scala's unparalleled type system.
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is ~20 hours in length, with lectures 15-30 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focussed learning at one time.
  - question: How is a typical lesson like?
    answer: Code is king, and we write it from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts, either briefly on a diagram or directly in the code. We then run live examples, and usually I'll finish the lesson with some exercises, which I then solve on camera after you've tried them yourself.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is the course hard?
    answer: Not if you've taken the beginners course or you have at least a year of Scala experience. I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
  - question: I've just started with Scala. Should I take this course?
    answer: I won't recommend it - the concepts here will probably crush you if you don't have a solid foundation. Take a look at the beginners course, or come back here once you have at least a year of Scala experience.
  - question: I'm an advanced Scala user. Should I take this course?
    answer: Even if I don't know your exact experience, I'm willing to bet there are at least a few things here that will leave you "huh, I didn't know that.".
  - question: How is this different from the Udemy Advanced Scala course?
    answer: This course is a COMPLETE revamp of the course which you can see on Udemy. This premium version has more content (20h > 13h), new lessons, better exercises and more code (3.5k > 2k), with a much smoother learning experience. It's also specifically built for Scala 3, which is particularly important at this level.
