description: Learn Spark Streaming on big data in real time with Scala. Integrate any data source, from Kafka to Twitter.
excerpt: <p>Process massive data as <strong>it arrives</strong>. Integrate Spark with Kafka, JDBC, Cassandra and anything you want. Process live tweets in real time and stream data like you own it.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is a full 11 hours in length, with lessons 20-30 minutes each, and we write 2200 lines of code. For a complex topic like Spark Streaming, I don't believe in 5-minute lectures or in fill-in-the-blanks quizzes. To learn Spark Streaming in the most effective way, I recommend chunks of 1 hour of learning at a time.
  - question: How will I learn Spark Streaming in this course?
    answer: Code is king, and we write from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts in short, then I'll dive right into the code. We'll write it together, and at every topic I will give you exercises. You'll usually pause the video to try them yourself, after which I will also solve them on camera.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! Most (wise) companies will reimburse employees taking courses like this, and it's a really cheap training for them.
  - question: Is Spark Streaming difficult to learn?
    answer: It could be, if you're learning on your own, but I've designed this course with a clear learning path that you can follow step by step. The course was designed to give you a challenge so you're not bored, but not so much that you flip the table in anger. In case you struggle, we have a community willing to help, and I'm responsive for questions!
  - question: What if I'm not happy with the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: Daniel, I can't afford the course. What do I do?
    answer: For a while, I told everyone who could not afford the course to email me and I gave them discounts. But then I looked at the stats. Almost all the people who actually took the time and completed the course had paid for it in full. So I'm not offering discounts anymore. This is an investment in yourself, which will pay off 100x if you commit.
  - question: I have very little Scala or Spark experience. Can I learn Spark Streaming?
    answer: I don't recommend diving into Spark Streaming without any previous Spark experience. We have two recap lessons at the beginning, but they're not a crash course into Scala or Spark. You should take the Scala beginners course and the Spark Essentials course at least.
  - question: What is Spark Streaming anyway?
    answer: Spark Streaming is an extension to the the popular big data computing engine Apache Spark. While the "classical" Spark engine allows you to process massive data of any scale in a "static" way (data at rest), Spark Streaming gives you the opportunity to process data at scale immediately as it arrives, hence allowing you to process potentially infinite amounts of data.

    ### Become a Kotlin pro.

    If you're on this page, Kotlin will need no introduction. You know the basics, and you've written your fair share of Kotlin in production for your projects, either personal or at work.

    Perhaps your codebase has become larger than you can manage, or you would like to become a senior developer, or need to write libraries and tools for other team members.

    For this, you need **deep knowledge** of Kotlin's type system and internals, so that you can create the best tools.

    **This course is for you.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="question">
    ### Oh yeah.
    You already know that Kotlin is such a game changer. It's very pragmatic, very flexible, has a powerful compiler, and allows you to write concise code that's easy for other people to understand.

    But there's far more to it.

    Beyond essentials OOP or functional principles, Kotlin has features that few developers have mastered. Kotlin's type system is among the best on the JVM, and the tools to manipulate types and code at runtime are top notch.

    With these tools, you can write **libraries, tools for other developers, frameworks for large codebases**, and much more.

    This is what you'll learn in this advanced Kotlin course.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature1">
    ### Who is this course is for?
    This course is best for **Kotlin developers who need to deeply understand the internals of Kotlin** and use its type system to write complex applications, libraries, tools, code generators or analyzers.

    **If you're a Kotlin developer looking to become senior, this course is for you.**

    If this is your first time with Kotlin, the [Kotlin Essentials](/courses/kotlin-essentials) course is your best starting point.

    And rest assured - if you buy this course and find that it's not for you, you'll get your money back anytime ðŸ’°.

    This course is 100% hands-on - this picture shows the code we write in this course.

  <Fragment slot="feature2">
    ### Platform Agnostic
    Many people learn Kotlin to build Android apps. Like the [Kotlin Essentials course](/courses/kotlin-essentials), **this advanced course does <ins>not</ins> focus on Android**, but on Kotlin itself.

    The skills you get in this course will allow you to build **complex systems, libraries and tools for other developers**. Notice that this applies to Android, the JVM, native code, KotlinJS, or anything else - **this course transcends any platform!**

    If you are specifically looking for an Android course, this course is still useful because after you finish this course, you can study the Android specifics without thinking too much about Kotlin - because by this time it will be second nature to you.

    **Regardless of what your goal is, this Kotlin course will help you no matter where you deploy your code.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature3">
    ### 100% Practical
    As always, **code is king, and we write it from scratch.**

    We don't waste time on endless theory, and I only use a few slides every lesson as "flashcards" you can come back to. You'll also get the slides in PDF for easy recall.

    Besides the dozens of examples that demonstrate the most complex Kotlin features, we spend a lot of time in **real-life exercises**, where we try to write (at small scale) the same kind of tools you'd be in charge of at work.

    The picture you see here is a mini-library we write in the course for HTML rendering with a nice DSL.

    In the process, you'll get hands-on experience not only with the hard Kotlin features, but you'll get a sense of **what it's like to write complex code** for other people.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="skills">

    - <p>write libraries and tools for other developers</p>
    - <p>use the Kotlin type system for generic, easily reusable code</p>
