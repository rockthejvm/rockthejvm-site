description: Learn Spark Streaming on big data in real time with Scala. Integrate any data source, from Kafka to Twitter.
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is a full 11 hours in length, with lessons 20-30 minutes each, and we write 2200 lines of code. For a complex topic like Spark Streaming, I don't believe in 5-minute lectures or in fill-in-the-blanks quizzes. To learn Spark Streaming in the most effective way, I recommend chunks of 1 hour of learning at a time.
  - question: How will I learn Spark Streaming in this course?
    answer: Code is king, and we write from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts in short, then I'll dive right into the code. We'll write it together, and at every topic I will give you exercises. You'll usually pause the video to try them yourself, after which I will also solve them on camera.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! Most (wise) companies will reimburse employees taking courses like this, and it's a really cheap training for them.
  - question: Is Spark Streaming difficult to learn?
    answer: It could be, if you're learning on your own, but I've designed this course with a clear learning path that you can follow step by step. The course was designed to give you a challenge so you're not bored, but not so much that you flip the table in anger. In case you struggle, we have a community willing to help, and I'm responsive for questions!
  - question: What if I'm not happy with the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: Daniel, I can't afford the course. What do I do?
    answer: For a while, I told everyone who could not afford the course to email me and I gave them discounts. But then I looked at the stats. Almost all the people who actually took the time and completed the course had paid for it in full. So I'm not offering discounts anymore. This is an investment in yourself, which will pay off 100x if you commit.
  - question: I have very little Scala or Spark experience. Can I learn Spark Streaming?
    answer: I don't recommend diving into Spark Streaming without any previous Spark experience. We have two recap lessons at the beginning, but they're not a crash course into Scala or Spark. You should take the Scala beginners course and the Spark Essentials course at least.
  - question: What is Spark Streaming anyway?
    answer: Spark Streaming is an extension to the the popular big data computing engine Apache Spark. While the "classical" Spark engine allows you to process massive data of any scale in a "static" way (data at rest), Spark Streaming gives you the opportunity to process data at scale immediately as it arrives, hence allowing you to process potentially infinite amounts of data.

      Process massive data <strong>as it arrives</strong>. Integrate Spark with
      Kafka, JDBC, Cassandra and anything you want. Process live tweets in real
      time and stream data like you own it.
