# faqs:
#  Is this course hard?
# It's not "hard", but it assumes some things (like actor communication) already known. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
# I've never written Scala or Akka before. Should I take this course?
# Go away. No, just kidding. Take a look at the Scala and Akka fundamentals here on the site first before taking this course.
