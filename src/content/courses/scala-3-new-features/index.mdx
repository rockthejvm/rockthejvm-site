category: scala
difficulty: intermediate
excerpt: <p>Discover Scala 3's new features without re-learning the language &mdash; a concise course designed for Scala 2 developers</p>
faqs:
  - question: Why should I upgrade to Scala 3?
    answer: Scala 3 brings new features (enums, extension methods, context abstractions, and type lambdas) that simplify development, improves compiler performance, and ensures backward compatibility. Upgrading will make future updates easier and the language more expressive.
  - question: Is Scala 3 production ready?
    answer: Yes, Scala 3 is production and has been for awhile. Many companies have already migrated to Scala 3, and the language is stable and ready for use in your projects.
  - question: Is Scala 3 hard to learn?
    answer: Not at all. Scala 3 is generally easier for beginners compared to Scala 2, and existing Scala developers will find it manageable, though some new features, like type lambdas, can be challenging. We'll explain everything with clear examples in this course.
  - question: How much time do I need to learn Scala 3?
    answer: Learning Scala 3 on your own through blog posts, documentation, books, and videos can take several dozen hours. This course aims to cover everything you need in just a few hours.
  - question: How is this course different from other Scala 3 courses on Rock the JVM?
    answer: This course is specifically designed for Scala 2 developers transitioning to Scala 3. Unlike the Scala Essentials and Advanced courses, this course is just a few hours long and focuses on the key differences.
  - question: Does the course include migration strategies?
    answer: No, this course focuses solely on the changes in the Scala language and runtime. Migration is often specific to each project, and including general patterns would have made the course too lengthy. For feedback, contact me at rockthejvm.com/contact.
  - question: Does the course include the new Scala 3 metaprogramming?
    answer: Scala 3 metaprogramming will be covered in a separate course dedicated to this advanced topic, coming soon.
  - question: Does Spark support Scala 3?
    answer: At the time of writing, Spark supports Scala 2.13. Since Scala 3 is backward compatible with 2.13, an update to Scala 3 is expected in the near future.
  - question: Does ___ support Scala 3?
    answer: Many libraries and tools are being upgraded to support Scala 3. Most Typelevel libraries (e.g., Cats, Cats Effect) already support it, ZIO 2.0 supports it out of the box, and Akka is expected to release Scala 3-native artifacts soon.

### Learn Scala 3 new features now.

If you're reading this, you're a Scala developer. Unless you've been like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, you know Scala just took a major leap: Scala 3 is a revolutionary step in the evolution of the language and there are lots of changes to simplify our lives as developers. LOTS of them.

Geting yourself familiar with Scala 3 new features can be a challenge, since there are so many changes in the language, a million places on the web describing bits and pieces, and your time is limited. If you're like me, you don't want to spend dozens of hours scouring the web or learning the upgraded Scala 3 [Essentials](/courses/scala-essentials) and [Advanced](/courses/advanced-scala) courses here on Rock the JVM all over again.

### The main value of the course is that it saves you time.

This course is compact and will give you everything you need in just **4 hours**. By comparison, I've spent thousands of hours learning everything there is to know about Scala here for Rock the JVM, and I've stalked the Scala 3 repo and studied the impact of Scala 3 changes for hundreds of hours, so that you get the same insight in an afternoon instead of a month.

Short as it is, the course packs a punch - we write **1000+ lines of code** in this course! If you know my style, you know I like to get straight to the point and I won't waste a minute of your time.

Time is your most valuable resource. My pledge to you is that in this course, you'll spend it well.

### Skills you'll get:

- Understand how the Scala language and runtime changed
- Use the new abstractions in Scala 3
- Use new simplified syntax in Scala 3
- Maintain your code style in Scala 3 (if conservative)
- Change your code style in Scala 3 to braceless and indentation (if adventurous)
- Cut the removed features of Scala 2 out of your code before upgrading to Scala 3
- Organize your code better with the new importing features
- Interoperate better with Java

### How this course helps you:

- It walks you through each important change in the language so you know what to do at work
- It gives you examples that are relevant for real Scala projects
- It gives you just the tips you need, without going through basics all over again
- It organizes the changes that will likely affect you, so that you won't spend time asking _how is this relevant?_
- It selects and sequences out the topics so they click in your head
