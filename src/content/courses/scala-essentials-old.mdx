faqs:
  - question: How is this course different than the Scala 3 version?
    answer: Scala 3 has a number of features that Scala 2 doesn't have; a lot of things changed. Also, the Scala 3 version has many improvements on how I explain complex topics, new exercises, a smoother learning curve and more code.
  - question: I'm just starting with Scala. Which course should I take, this one or the one with Scala 3?
    answer: Take the Scala 3 version. It's better by almost all metrics and you'll learn the latest Scala too.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is the course hard?
    answer: I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
