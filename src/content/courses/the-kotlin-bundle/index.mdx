# faqs:
#   - question: Is this Kotlin masterclass hard?
# answer: If you have some existing experience coding in another language, this bundle will give you a consistent brain stretch, but not so much that you burn out. If you're stuck on something, we're happy to help in our private community.
#   - question: I'm already an advanced Kotlin user. Should I take this bundle?
# answer: Then I think you're good.

    ### Learn everything about Kotlin.

    You probably know already: Kotlin is one of the most powerful language on the JVM, increasing in popularity, with solid support for backend, mobile, web and multiplatform in the same project. It's taken the most powerful features from other languages while avoiding their pitfalls. The company behind Kotlin (JetBrains) has executed beautifully.

    Kotlin has a bright future.

    Therefore, so do you.

    **This bundle contains everything you need to master Kotlin from scratch, even if you have never written a line of Kotlin in your life.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature1">
    ### From Zero to Master

    Long story short: this masterclass contains multiple courses, and if you follow all of them in sequence, **you can become a Kotlin master, starting with zero experience.**

    We start by assuming you have some existing programming experience in some other language (could be anything).

    We take everything about Kotlin and break it down step by step, covering

    - <p>syntax & basic structure</p>
    - <p>type inference</p>
    - <p>functions</p>
    - <p>object-oriented programming</p>
    - <p>Kotlin-specific features</p>
    - <p>functional programming principles</p>
    - <p>Kotlin type system</p>
    - <p>Kotlin internals</p>
    - <p>and much more.</p>

    After writing thousands of lines of code in hundreds of examples and exercises inspired by real-life experience, **you will get Kotlin skills in a few weeks instead of a few years.**

  <Fragment slot="feature2">
    ### 100% Hands-On

    There's no way around hard skill than hard practice.

    It doesn't mean that it has to be difficult (it's not), but we put in a lot of code in this Kotlin masterclass.

    We write code in the thousands of lines, with dozens of real-life examples and exercises. Every bit of code we write in these courses was taken from experience, and the experience of my personal clients.

    **I trained one team at the Google Wearables team with the materials in this bundle.**

    These Kotlin courses

      - <p>deconstruct all Kotlin features</p>
      - <p>select the most important topics to learn</p>
      - <p>sequence all the ideas and exercises to click along the way</p>
      - <p>solidify everything with code written live on camera</p>

    By the end of this Kotlin masterclass, you will get the skills of a senior developer not because you watched a bunch of videos, but because you've written the code that a senior developer would.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature3">
    ### 100% Fun

    All examples and exercises in this bundle are realistic and practical, but that doesn't mean boring.

    We write the code that we would start from if we built our own projects or our own business.

    What you see here is a project that we build in the Kotlin Essentials course: a command-line "photoshop" that I personally use on my own photos, so that my grandkids can make fun of me when I'm old.
