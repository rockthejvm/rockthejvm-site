# faqs:
#   - question: Is this Kotlin masterclass hard?
# answer: If you have some existing experience coding in another language, this bundle will give you a consistent brain stretch, but not so much that you burn out. If you're stuck on something, we're happy to help in our private community.
#   - question: I'm already an advanced Kotlin user. Should I take this bundle?
# answer: Then I think you're good.

### Learn everything about Kotlin.

You probably know already: Kotlin is one of the most powerful language on the JVM, increasing in popularity, with solid support for backend, mobile, web and multiplatform in the same project. It's taken the most powerful features from other languages while avoiding their pitfalls. The company behind Kotlin (JetBrains) has executed beautifully.

Kotlin has a bright future.

Therefore, so do you.

**This bundle contains everything you need to master Kotlin from scratch, even if you have never written a line of Kotlin in your life.**

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="feature1">
### From Zero to Master

Long story short: this masterclass contains multiple courses, and if you follow all of them in sequence, **you can become a Kotlin master, starting with zero experience.**

We start by assuming you have some existing programming experience in some other language (could be anything).

We take everything about Kotlin and break it down step by step, covering

- syntax & basic structure
- type inference
- functions
- object-oriented programming
- Kotlin-specific features
- functional programming principles
- Kotlin type system
- Kotlin internals
- and much more.

After writing thousands of lines of code in hundreds of examples and exercises inspired by real-life experience, **you will get Kotlin skills in a few weeks instead of a few years.**

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="feature2">
### 100% Hands-On

There's no way around hard skill than hard practice.

It doesn't mean that it has to be difficult (it's not), but we put in a lot of code in this Kotlin masterclass.

We write code in the thousands of lines, with dozens of real-life examples and exercises. Every bit of code we write in these courses was taken from experience, and the experience of my personal clients.

**I trained one team at the Google Wearables team with the materials in this bundle.**

These Kotlin courses

- deconstruct all Kotlin features
- select the most important topics to learn
- sequence all the ideas and exercises to click along the way
- solidify everything with code written live on camera

By the end of this Kotlin masterclass, you will get the skills of a senior developer not because you watched a bunch of videos, but because you've written the code that a senior developer would.

<Fragment slot="feature3">
### 100% Fun

All examples and exercises in this bundle are realistic and practical, but that doesn't mean boring.

We write the code that we would start from if we built our own projects or our own business.

What you see here is a project that we build in the Kotlin Essentials course: a command-line "photoshop" that I personally use on my own photos, so that my grandkids can make fun of me when I'm old.

### After completing this Kotlin masterclass, you'll be equipped to:

- Understand and work with Kotlin in any codebase, of any complexity
- Develop advanced tools for other developers or libraries as open-source projects
- Lead other developers on Kotlin best practice
- Understand existing Kotlin libraries and tools like a boss
- Be effective while working with parallel applications
- Work on any platform that Kotlin compiles for, including Android, multiplatform, desktop, server or the web

### Kotlin features we cover in this masterclass:

- Lasting comfort with the Kotlin language
    - syntax (of course)
    - types and type inference
    - expressions vs instructions
    - control structures and how they differ from other languages
    - string templating
- Extended object-oriented concepts
    - classes, instances, constructors, properties, methods, the usual
    - nullables
    - new method notations for expressive code
    - extension methods
    - operator overloading
    - the singleton pattern in one line of code
    - inheritance
    - abstract classes and interfaces
    - generics
    - exception handling
    - delegation
    - anonymous classes
    - value classes
    - enums
- Functional programming
    - using functions as values
    - anonymous functions (lambdas)
    - higher-order functions
    - collections and their "standard" and functional APIs
    - single-abstract-method patterns (SAM)
- Kotlin type system mastery
    - OOP and FP
    - Delegation and delegated properties
    - Standard delegated properties
    - Variance and variance positions
- Kotlin internals proficiency
    - Contracts and compiler type checks
    - Inline functions and performance optimization
    - Circumventing JVM type erasure
    - Reified types
    - Reflection
    - Creating code generators and analyzers
    - Writing symbol processors
- Coroutines
    - Suspending functions
    - Coroutine builders
    - Structured concurrency
    - Cancellation
    - Error handling
    - Cooperative scheduling
    - Configuring coroutine platforms
- Advanced coroutine tools
    - Flows
    - Channels
    - Testing & manipulating time

Basically, everything you'll ever need to know to be a Kotlin master.

### Additional perks:

- Full access to all the code written during the courses — over 6000 lines of Kotlin!
- Invitation to join a private Slack community, where you'll get exclusive updates, opportunities, and discussions
- Access to all slides for easy reference
- Free updates and expansions, no expiration date
