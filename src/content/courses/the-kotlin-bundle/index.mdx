description: Learn everything about Kotlin, from zero to master.
excerpt: <p>Become a Kotlin master from scratch. Take all Kotlin courses at a discount, write thousands of lines of code, and become one of the top developers in weeks instead of years.</p>
faqs:
  - question: Does this bundle cover Android?
    answer: Not yet - the bundle currently focuses on Kotlin mastery as a language, so that you can apply these skills on any platform, including Android of course!
  - question: How is a typical lesson?
    answer: We generally create separate mini-applications where we'll explore a certain feature of the Kotlin language, with examples and exercises. Each lesson is about 10-30 mins long.
  - question: Is this Kotlin masterclass hard?
    answer: If you have some existing experience coding in another language, this bundle will give you a consistent brain stretch, but not so much that you burn out. If you're stuck on something, we're happy to help in our private community.
  - question: Do you give a certificate?
    answer: Yep! Every course comes with its own certificate once you finish it, so that you can reimburse this bundle with your employer or get a Kotlin job.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enroll, you'll automatically get a tax-compliant receipt which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: I'm already an advanced Kotlin user. Should I take this bundle?
    answer: Then I think you're good.
  - question: I'm a senior and want to give this bundle to some juniors in my team, can I audit this bundle?
    answer: Happy to help - reach out at daniel@rockthejvm.com.
  - question: What if I don't like the bundle?
    answer: Money back, easy 💰 Only a handful of people ever asked for a refund on the entire site of 20+ courses, just to give you an idea.

    ### Learn everything about Kotlin.

    You probably know already: Kotlin is one of the most powerful language on the JVM, increasing in popularity, with solid support for backend, mobile, web and multiplatform in the same project. It's taken the most powerful features from other languages while avoiding their pitfalls. The company behind Kotlin (JetBrains) has executed beautifully.

    Kotlin has a bright future.

    Therefore, so do you.

    **This bundle contains everything you need to master Kotlin from scratch, even if you have never written a line of Kotlin in your life.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature1">
    ### From Zero to Master

    Long story short: this masterclass contains multiple courses, and if you follow all of them in sequence, **you can become a Kotlin master, starting with zero experience.**

    We start by assuming you have some existing programming experience in some other language (could be anything).

    We take everything about Kotlin and break it down step by step, covering

    - <p>syntax & basic structure</p>
    - <p>type inference</p>
    - <p>functions</p>
    - <p>object-oriented programming</p>
    - <p>Kotlin-specific features</p>
    - <p>functional programming principles</p>
    - <p>Kotlin type system</p>
    - <p>Kotlin internals</p>
    - <p>and much more.</p>

    After writing thousands of lines of code in hundreds of examples and exercises inspired by real-life experience, **you will get Kotlin skills in a few weeks instead of a few years.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature2">
    ### 100% Hands-On

    There's no way around hard skill than hard practice.

    It doesn't mean that it has to be difficult (it's not), but we put in a lot of code in this Kotlin masterclass.

    We write code in the thousands of lines, with dozens of real-life examples and exercises. Every bit of code we write in these courses was taken from experience, and the experience of my personal clients.

    **I trained one team at the Google Wearables team with the materials in this bundle.**

    These Kotlin courses

      - <p>deconstruct all Kotlin features</p>
      - <p>select the most important topics to learn</p>
      - <p>sequence all the ideas and exercises to click along the way</p>
      - <p>solidify everything with code written live on camera</p>

    By the end of this Kotlin masterclass, you will get the skills of a senior developer not because you watched a bunch of videos, but because you've written the code that a senior developer would.

  <Fragment slot="feature3">
    ### 100% Fun

    All examples and exercises in this bundle are realistic and practical, but that doesn't mean boring.

    We write the code that we would start from if we built our own projects or our own business.

    What you see here is a project that we build in the Kotlin Essentials course: a command-line "photoshop" that I personally use on my own photos, so that my grandkids can make fun of me when I'm old.
