faqs:
    - question: How does this course differ from the Udemy "Scala & Functional Programming Essentials" course?
      answer: This course is a fully re-recorded and updated version of the Udemy course, featuring additional content, lessons, exercises, and code. It offers a smoother learning curve and is specifically designed for Scala 3, reflecting its future direction.
#   - question: I've never written code before. Should I take this course? It says it's for beginners.
# answer: The course is for "beginners" in that you've never written Scala before, but the course already assumes existing programming experience. I don't talk too much about the absolute basics, like what's a variable, an object or a method. I assume you know what they are, and I quickly move to how Scala works with them.
#   - question: I'm an advanced Scala user. Should I take this course?
#     answer: Probably not. I'd recommend the advanced Scala course in this case. I'm willing to bet that there are at least 3 topics or techniques in the advanced course you did not know, even if you've written Scala for 10 years.
#   - question: Is this course hard?
#     answer: I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.

### Think differently.

If you're reading this, you probably know already: Scala is one of the most powerful languages on the JVM and is behind some of the best libraries and frameworks for big data processing (Spark), distributed & fault-tolerant computing (Akka/Pekko), streaming (Kafka, Akka/Pekko Streams), effect systems (Cats Effect, ZIO) and many others.

Scala has seen huge demand in recent years, has [some of the best-paid engineering positions](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#work-_-salary-and-experience-by-language), and is just plain fun. I know you can't verify the fun for yourself right now, but I personally hardly know anyone who has tasted Scala and then came back to Java out of their own free will. I also have a stadium of 100000+ students (as of Feb 2024) who took my courses and say the same thing.

### After this course, you'll be able to:
- Understand Scala in production environments and in any project
- Expand your existing object-oriented concepts to a new mindset with immutable values
- Think code differently with functional programming
- Write powerful code very quickly: 1-2 lines of Scala code enough for 50 lines of Java
- Contribute to products and open-source projects written in Scala
- Write applications in Scala from scratch
- Quickly learn any Scala framework and library: Spark, Cats/Cats Effect, ZIO, Pekko and many others

### Skills you'll get:

- Lasting comfort with the Scala language
    - think code differently with values and expressions
    - use blocks of code as expressions
    - write compact code with recursion
    - master the 2 recursion techniques
    - use the 3 string interpolation techniques in different scenarios
    - use the compiler's type inference effectively
- Extended object-oriented concepts
    - immutable values
    - the 3 method notations for expressive code
    - singleton patterns in one line of code
    - inheritance in Scala
    - abstract classes and traits
    - anonymous classes
    - generics (which are generally poorly understood)
    - exception handling
- Functional programming
    - using functions as values
    - anonymous functions (lambdas)
    - the underscore notation and alternative syntax
    - higher-order functions
    - collections
    - map, flatMap, filter
- Scala-only features
    - pattern matching
    - variance (introduction)
    - for-comprehensions
