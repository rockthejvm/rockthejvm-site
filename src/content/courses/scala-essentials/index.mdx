faqs:
  - question: How does this course differ from the Udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scala & Functional Programming Essentials</a> course?
    answer: This course is a fully re-recorded and updated version of the Udemy course, featuring additional content, lessons, exercises, and code. It offers a smoother learning curve and is specifically designed for Scala 3, reflecting its future direction.
#   - question: I've never written code before. Should I take this course? It says it's for beginners.
# answer: The course is for "beginners" in that you've never written Scala before, but the course already assumes existing programming experience. I don't talk too much about the absolute basics, like what's a variable, an object or a method. I assume you know what they are, and I quickly move to how Scala works with them.
#   - question: I'm an advanced Scala user. Should I take this course?
#     answer: Probably not. I'd recommend the advanced Scala course in this case. I'm willing to bet that there are at least 3 topics or techniques in the advanced course you did not know, even if you've written Scala for 10 years.
#   - question: Is this course hard?
#     answer: I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.

    ### Think differently.

    If you're reading this, you probably know already: Scala is one of the most powerful languages on the JVM and is behind some of the best libraries and frameworks for big data processing (Spark), distributed & fault-tolerant computing (Akka/Pekko), streaming (Kafka, Akka/Pekko Streams), effect systems (Cats Effect, ZIO) and many others.

    Scala has seen huge demand in recent years, has [some of the best-paid engineering positions](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#work-_-salary-and-experience-by-language), and is just plain fun. I know you can't verify the fun for yourself right now, but I personally hardly know anyone who has tasted Scala and then came back to Java out of their own free will. I also have a stadium of 100000+ students (as of Feb 2024) who took my courses and say the same thing.
