description: The Scala 3 online course for software engineers. A hands-on training course into the fundamentals of Scala and functional programming.
difficulty: intermediate
excerpt: <p><strong>Now with Scala 3.</strong> Become a Scala programmer. Dive head-first and hands-on into the fundamentals of Scala and functional programming. <a href="/courses/scala-essentials-old">Also available for Scala 2.</a></p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is ~12 hours in length, with lectures 20 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focused learning at one time.
  - question: How is a typical lesson like?
    answer: Code is king, and we write it from scratch. In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts, either briefly on a diagram or directly in the code. We then run live examples, and usually I'll finish the lesson with some exercises, which I then solve on camera after you've tried them yourself.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is the course hard?
    answer: I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
  - question: I'm an advanced Scala user. Should I take this course?
    answer: Probably not. I'd recommend the advanced Scala course in this case. I'm willing to bet that there are at least 3 topics or techniques in the advanced course you did not know, even if you've written Scala for 10 years.
  - question: I've never written code before. Should I take this course? It says it's for beginners.
    answer: The course is for "beginners" in that you've never written Scala before, but the course already assumes existing programming experience. I don't talk too much about the absolute basics, like what's a variable, an object or a method. I assume you know what they are, and I quickly move to how Scala works with them.
  - question: How is this different from the Udemy Scala & FP for beginners course?
    answer: This course is a complete re-record of the course which you see on Udemy. This premium version has more content, more lessons, more exercises and more code, with a smoother learning curve. It's also specifically built for Scala 3, which is the future.

    ### Think differently.

    If you're reading this, you probably know already: Scala is one of the most powerful languages on the JVM and is behind some of the best libraries and frameworks for big data processing (Spark), distributed & fault-tolerant computing (Akka/Pekko), streaming (Kafka, Akka/Pekko Streams), effect systems (Cats Effect, ZIO) and many others.

    Scala has seen huge demand in recent years, has [some of the best-paid engineering positions](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#work-_-salary-and-experience-by-language), and is just plain fun. I know you can't verify the fun for yourself right now, but I personally hardly know anyone who has tasted Scala and then came back to Java out of their own free will. I also have a stadium of 100000+ students (as of Feb 2024) who took my courses and say the same thing.
