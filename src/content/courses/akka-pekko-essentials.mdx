description: The Akka/Pekko online course that teaches you to build distributed applications on the JVM.
excerpt: <p>Enough threads and locks and headaches. Meet the <strong>Actor Model</strong>. Dive into a better way of thinking concurrent and distributed code.</p> # TODO: Also with classic actors.
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is ~10 hours in length, with lectures 15-30 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focused learning at one time.
  - question: How is a usual lesson like?
    answer: We focus on code, so we'll spend most of our time in the dev environment. In the lessons where new concepts are introduced, I'll add some diagrams or animations to make it crystal clear. Many lessons will also contain exercises, so you can pause the video and try them, and I show you a proposed solution every time.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is this course hard?
    answer: I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: I've never written Scala before. Should I take this course?
    answer: Not really. The course is for Scala programmers. Even though we do a bit of a recap at the beginning of the course to make sure we're all on the same page, that part is not enough to give you confident skills with Scala if you've never seen it before.
  - question: I don't know how threads work. Should I take this course?
    answer: Not recommended. You should at least understand what threads are and how a normal computer can do multiple things at the same time.
  - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and threads and I'm curious about this actor model. Should I take this course?
    answer: Yes! This course is made for you.
  - question: Daniel, I want to join but I can't afford it.
    answer: Check out the Rock the JVM Membership (/memberships) for the cheapest option.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 0.1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
