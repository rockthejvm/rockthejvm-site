# faqs:
#  Is this course hard?
# Only if you've never done Scala or Akka before. I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
# I've never written Scala or Akka before. Should I take this course?I've
# You shouldn't. The course is for Scala programmers who are already familiar with Akka. Even though we do a bit of a recap at the beginning of the course to make sure we're all on the same page, that part is not enough to give you confident skills if you've never seen actors before.
# I'm comfortable with Scala and Akka and I need to make my system distributed. Should I take this course?
# Yes! This course is for you.

### Distributed systems, baby.
If you're reading this, you're not just familiar with Akka, but you're probably pretty good already and you may have seen its power in action, like [all](https://www.lightbend.com/case-studies) [these](https://x.com/lightbend/status/1067393653356802048?lang=en) [other](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/product-design/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont-linkedins-real-time-presence-platf) [places](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/wasdevops/viewdocument/reactive-commerce-transformation-jo-1?CommunityKey=5c4ba155-561a-4794-9883-bb0c6164e14e&tab=librarydocuments).

Here, we take things up a notch. We learn how to create truly distributed systems with distributed problems and distributed solutions. We spin up actors on other JVMs now. We learn to make many JVMs dance in clusters and handle things nicely if one stumbles.

### After this course, you'll be able to:

- interact with actor systems on different JVMs or on other machines
- remotely deploy actors on other JVMs, and use them like they were your own
- use clustering for distributed fault-tolerant computation
- configure clusters and transport protocols
- coordinate large-scale distributed applications with Cluster Singleton
- distribute massive actors and logic with Cluster Sharding
- implement an imaginary London Tube infrastructure with clusters and sharding

Plus some extra perks:

- You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (all 1214 lines of it)
- You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
- (soon) You'll have access to the takeaway slides
- (soon) You'll be able to download the videos for your offline view

### Skills you'll get:

- Work with remote actors
  - locate actors on other JVMs and other machines
  - effectively use ActorSelection for remote access
  - deploy actors remotely on other machines via configuration
  - deploy actors remotely at runtime
- Distribute applications with Clustering
  - manage cluster membership
  - distribute tasks in a cluster
  - uniformly delegate tasks with cluster-aware routers
  - configure seed clusters
  - join any cluster programmatically at runtime
- Benefit from true distributed fault-tolerance
  - use Cluster Singleton in a distributed environment
  - manage singleton life cycle
  - split a massive actor or massive distributed logic into shards
  - control how shards are created in a large-scale system
  - balance the load of your distributed systems with sharding techniques

all with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises. We even create a simulation of the crowded London Underground system with Akka clusters and Cluster Sharding.
