# faqs:
#  Is this course hard?
# Only if you've never done Scala or Akka before. I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
# I've never written Scala or Akka before. Should I take this course?I've
# You shouldn't. The course is for Scala programmers who are already familiar with Akka. Even though we do a bit of a recap at the beginning of the course to make sure we're all on the same page, that part is not enough to give you confident skills if you've never seen actors before.
# I'm comfortable with Scala and Akka and I need to make my system distributed. Should I take this course?
# Yes! This course is for you.
