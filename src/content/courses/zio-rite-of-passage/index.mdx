description: Learn Scala, ZIO and Laminar to build full-stack applications with the ZIO stack. Build a full-blown product with emails, credit card checkout, and more.
difficulty: advanced
excerpt: <p>Build your product. Use the ZIO stack to <strong>build your own full-stack application in Scala 3</strong>, with credit card checkout, AI, emails, the real deal. The app we build is live <a href="https://companies.rockthejvm.com/">here</a>.</p>
faqs:
  - question: Nah, the ____ library for JSON with ____ for frontend is much bettter!
    answer: That's not a question, but okay - I have spent close to a year evaluating many combinations of setups, libraries and styles for building a full-stack app with ZIO. I found this set to be the best fit. All the libraries inside are well supported, actively developed, and this is the stack I'd use to build a new app - heck, I did build one on camera. This course isn't just teaching you how to hook together a few libs - you are learning to think and build full stack Scala 3 applications. The ideas behind this course transcend all libraries!
  - question: How about the Typelevel stack?
    answer: I have a course just as big for Typelevel, on a different app and with a totally different mode of thinking.
  - question: Is this course included with the membership?
    answer: "All members will have a massive discount to this course under their account. So the benefits of being a member will only increase with time, regardless of what I create next. How to claim the discount: click on the membership card in the course dashboard, and you'll see the code inside."
  - question: Do you give a certificate?
    answer: Yep! You'll automatically get a certificate which you can export and use this to get reimbursed or land your dream Scala job. The real reward, though, is when you make your own app with the ideas you learned in this course!
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: For sure! After you enroll, you'll automatically get a tax-compliant receipt which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: What can I do with the code? Can I put it on GitHub?
    answer: It's your code, so go nuts! I just ask that you don't create your own course teaching with this app. You can use the code in this course as a portfolio project to get a job, a starting point to build your next trillion$ startup with Scala, or a quick prototype to impress your boss and convince them to use Scala. In any case, if you want to take something from the course, take the ideas, they're worth far more than the code.
  - question: Is the ZIO stack difficult?
    answer: It's not rocket science, but it's not trivial either. The learning curve is steep if you're doing it on your own. Materials are scarce. So I wanted to compress your learning time and hard-earned lessons into one comprehensive experience.
  - question: What if I'm not happy with the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: I'm just getting started with Scala. Can I take this course?
    answer: "Short answer: probably not. Longer answer: we have some Scala starter code at the beginning of the course, but that won't replace the kind of experience we need for this course. I recommend you check out the Scala essentials and advanced courses first before coming back here."
  - question: Where did you get the banner art for the course?
    answer: The banner was created by the amazing @fellownoodle. She made the banner specifically for this Rite of Passage.

    ### Become a Kotlin pro.

    If you're on this page, Kotlin will need no introduction. You know the basics, and you've written your fair share of Kotlin in production for your projects, either personal or at work.

    Perhaps your codebase has become larger than you can manage, or you would like to become a senior developer, or need to write libraries and tools for other team members.

    For this, you need **deep knowledge** of Kotlin's type system and internals, so that you can create the best tools.

    **This course is for you.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="question">
    ### Oh yeah.
    You already know that Kotlin is such a game changer. It's very pragmatic, very flexible, has a powerful compiler, and allows you to write concise code that's easy for other people to understand.

    But there's far more to it.

    Beyond essentials OOP or functional principles, Kotlin has features that few developers have mastered. Kotlin's type system is among the best on the JVM, and the tools to manipulate types and code at runtime are top notch.

    With these tools, you can write **libraries, tools for other developers, frameworks for large codebases**, and much more.

    This is what you'll learn in this advanced Kotlin course.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature1">
    ### Who is this course is for?
    This course is best for **Kotlin developers who need to deeply understand the internals of Kotlin** and use its type system to write complex applications, libraries, tools, code generators or analyzers.

    **If you're a Kotlin developer looking to become senior, this course is for you.**

    If this is your first time with Kotlin, the [Kotlin Essentials](/courses/kotlin-essentials) course is your best starting point.

    And rest assured - if you buy this course and find that it's not for you, you'll get your money back anytime ðŸ’°.

    This course is 100% hands-on - this picture shows the code we write in this course.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature2">
    ### Platform Agnostic
    Many people learn Kotlin to build Android apps. Like the [Kotlin Essentials course](/courses/kotlin-essentials), **this advanced course does <ins>not</ins> focus on Android**, but on Kotlin itself.

    The skills you get in this course will allow you to build **complex systems, libraries and tools for other developers**. Notice that this applies to Android, the JVM, native code, KotlinJS, or anything else - **this course transcends any platform!**

    If you are specifically looking for an Android course, this course is still useful because after you finish this course, you can study the Android specifics without thinking too much about Kotlin - because by this time it will be second nature to you.

    **Regardless of what your goal is, this Kotlin course will help you no matter where you deploy your code.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature3">
    ### 100% Practical
    As always, **code is king, and we write it from scratch.**

    We don't waste time on endless theory, and I only use a few slides every lesson as "flashcards" you can come back to. You'll also get the slides in PDF for easy recall.

    Besides the dozens of examples that demonstrate the most complex Kotlin features, we spend a lot of time in **real-life exercises**, where we try to write (at small scale) the same kind of tools you'd be in charge of at work.

    The picture you see here is a mini-library we write in the course for HTML rendering with a nice DSL.

    In the process, you'll get hands-on experience not only with the hard Kotlin features, but you'll get a sense of **what it's like to write complex code** for other people.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="skills">
    ### After this course, you'll be able to:
    - <p>understand the most complex Kotlin features</p>

    - <p>write libraries and tools for other developers</p>
    - <p>use the Kotlin type system for generic, easily reusable code</p>
    - <p>write frameworks that generate or analyze other source code</p>
