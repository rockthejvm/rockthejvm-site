faqs:
  - question: How does this course differ from the Udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-scala" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Advanced Scala and Functional Programming</a> course?
    answer: This course is a fully re-recorded and updated version of the Udemy course, featuring additional content, lessons, exercises, and code. It offers a smoother learning curve and is specifically designed for Scala 3, reflecting its future direction.
#   - question: Is this course hard?
#     answer: Not if you've taken the beginners course or you have at least a year of Scala experience. I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
#   - question: I've just started with Scala. Should I take this course?
# answer: I won't recommend it - the concepts here will probably crush you if you don't have a solid foundation. Take a look at the beginners course, or come back here once you have at least a year of Scala experience.
#   - question: I'm an advanced Scala user. Should I take this course?
# answer: Even if I don't know your exact experience, I'm willing to bet there are at least a few things here that will leave you "huh, I didn't know that.".

    ### Become a Scala pro.

    At this point, I don't need to pitch Scala to you. You've seen it in action, you know the basics, and I'm willing to bet you like it at least a bit.

    Perhaps you want to contribute to a bigger project, or need to write your own libraries at work so you can reuse them for a large system. Maybe you need to dive deep into a complex codebase or into a massive framework like Akka or Spark, but the internal code looks overwhelming.

    This course is for you. The course is for the Scala programmer who understands the essentials and wants to level up.

    **Now on Scala 3.**

    - <p>Mastering the Scala type system</p>
      - <p>Deeply understanding why Scala multi-inheritance is solid</p>
      - <p>Correctly applying variance (which 99% of Scala programmers can't... because they don't understand it)</p>

      - <p>Using higher-kinded types for generic libraries</p>
      - <p>Imposing type restrictions with recursive types and the academically-fancy-but-common-sense F-bounded polymorphism</p>
