faqs:
  - question: Is Scala 2 outdated?
    answer: Not yet - Scala 2 is still widely used, and the transition from Scala 2 to Scala 3 will still take a long time. Besides, most features that you'll learn in this course will still be applicable to Scala 3.
  - question: Should I take the Scala 3 version?
    answer: If you're starting fresh, yes. If your project requires you to use Scala 2, you should take this one; after that, the transition to Scala 3 will be easy.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is the course hard?
    answer: Not if you've taken the beginners course or you have at least a year of Scala experience. I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
  - question: I'm an advanced Scala user. Should I take this course?
    answer: If you're already fluent in Scala, try the Scala 3 course. I'm willing to bet you'll still learn a ton from it.
