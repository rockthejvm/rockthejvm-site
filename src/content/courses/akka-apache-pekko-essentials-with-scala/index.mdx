description: Become an Akka/Pekko developer with our essentials course. Master the fundamentals of Akka/Pekko with Scala and distributed JVM applications through clear lessons, practical exercises, and a smooth learning curve. Ideal for those with some programming experience, this course will quickly equip you with essential skills to effectively tackle real-world distributed challenges.
difficulty: intermediate
excerpt: '<p>Say goodbye to threads, locks, and headaches: meet the Actor Model and discover a smarter approach to concurrent and distributed coding &mdash; <a href="/courses/akka-classic-essentials-with-scala">classic actors also available</a></p>'
# faqs:
#   - question: Is this course hard?
#     answer: I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
#   - question: I've never written Scala before. Should I take this course?
# answer: Not really. The course is for Scala programmers. Even though we do a bit of a recap at the beginning of the course to make sure we're all on the same page, that part is not enough to give you confident skills with Scala if you've never seen it before.
#   - question: I don't know how threads work. Should I take this course?
# answer: Not recommended. You should at least understand what threads are and how a normal computer can do multiple things at the same time.
#   - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and threads and I'm curious about this actor model. Should I take this course?
# answer: Yes! This course is made for you.

### Think concurrency differently.

If you're reading this, you've probably heard about Akka, Pekko or the actor model. It's one of the most powerful abstractions of concurrent programming we've had, even though it's [not new](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)#%22Let_it_Crash%22_coding_style>). No more creating threads, no more locking, double-locking, deadlocks and concurrency problems. With actors, you can write heavily concurrent and distributed systems quickly, without the usual headaches. As such, massively parallel and distributed backends [all](https://www.lightbend.com/case-studies) [over](https://x.com/lightbend/status/1067393653356802048?lang=en) [the](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/product-design/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont-linkedins-real-time-presence-platf) place are powered by Akka.

This course is for the Scala developer willing to tap into the actor model and a new way of thinking parallel and distributed code.

**The course fully supports Akka (from Lightbend) as well as Pekko, the open-source version of Akka.**

### Main benefits of Akka or Pekko
- Write massively parallel and distributed applications more quickly
- Add resilience and fault tolerance to your applications without any great fuss
- Write code with an easy mental model you can relate to
- Easily test parallel apps, which are notoriously hard to test

### Write parallel code with actors instead of threads and locks

- Write parallel code with actors instead of threads and locks
- Manage actors in hierarchies
- Adopt the "let it crash" philosophy with your applications
- Configure Akka or Pekko for anything
- Test concurrent applications with actors
- Parallelize and delegate tasks to actors
- Use the best practices in working with the actor model

- Plus some extra perks:
  - You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (all 2200+ lines of it)
  - You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
  - You'll have access to the takeaway slides

### Skills you'll get:

- Work with actors instead of threads
  - Understand the thread model limitations
  - Adopt a new mindset with actors as the fundamental resource
  - Learn how actors are closest to the original object-oriented ideal
  - Send and receive messages
  - Change actor behavior dynamically
  - Spawn child actors and actor hierarchies
  - Learn about system guardians
  - Log messages for easier debugging
  - Learn how to configure an Akka/Pekko application in 5 different ways
- Test Akka applications
  - Use TestKit and assertions
  - Use TestProbes
  - Write timed assertions
  - Intercept actor logs to verify correct functionality
- Achieve fault-tolerance in parallel applications
  - Start and stop actors programmatically and via message passing
  - Manage actor lifecycle
  - Create supervisor strategies to recover from failure
  - Use the Backoff Supervisor pattern to access an external resource that failed
- Deeply understand and use the Akka or Pekko infrastructure
  - Schedule messages
  - Manage timeouts
  - Parallelize and distribute tasks to workers with Routers
  - Use custom dispatchers for underlying thread management
  - Use custom mailboxes to process messages on your own terms
- Learn advanced techniques
  - stash messages for later use
  - use the ask pattern for quick request-response interactions without any fuss
  - use the pipe pattern for integration with external services
  - all with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.

All with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.

### Plus some extra perks:

- You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (1800+ LOC)
- You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
- You'll have access to the takeaway slides
