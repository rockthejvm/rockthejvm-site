description: The Scala rockstar's course, for Scala 2.
difficulty: advanced
excerpt: <p>The Scala rockstar's course, for Scala 2.</p>
faqs:
  - question: Is Scala 2 outdated?
    answer: Not yet - Scala 2 is still widely used, and the transition from Scala 2 to Scala 3 will still take a long time. Besides, most features that you'll learn in this course will still be applicable to Scala 3.
  - question: Should I take the Scala 3 version?
    answer: If you're starting fresh, yes. If your project requires you to use Scala 2, you should take this one; after that, the transition to Scala 3 will be easy.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is the course hard?
    answer: Not if you've taken the beginners course or you have at least a year of Scala experience. I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
  - question: I'm an advanced Scala user. Should I take this course?
    answer: If you're already fluent in Scala, try the Scala 3 course. I'm willing to bet you'll still learn a ton from it.

    ### Become a pro, still live on Scala 2.

    Scala is a BEAST, but you already know that. This course taught 15000 Scala developers and transformed them into rockstars, now working at some of the best companies in the world.

    Although this course was recently revamped and [re-recorded from the ground up on Scala 3](https://rockthejvm.com/p/advanced-scala), but this course will continue to be live on Rock the JVM for as long as people still write Scala 2. In the meantime, here's what you get:
    - 2000 LOC written on camera
    - 13+ hours of HD video
    - Takeaway slides
    - Timeless Scala and functional programming skills
    - Exclusive access to the private Rock the JVM community
