difficulty: advanced
excerpt: <p>Become a Scala 3 rockstar by mastering Scala 3 and functional programming with our comprehensive, hands-on advanced course</p>
faqs:
  - question: Is Scala 2 outdated?
    answer: Not yet &ndash; Scala 2 remains widely used, and transitioning to Scala 3 will take time. Additionally, most features you'll learn in this course are still relevant to Scala 3.
  - question: How is this course different from the Scala 3 version?
    answer: Scala 3 introduces many new features and changes not present in Scala 2. The Scala 3 version also includes improved explanations of complex topics, new exercises, a smoother learning curve, and more code.
#   - question: I'm an advanced Scala user. Should I take this course?
# answer: If you're already fluent in Scala, consider the Scala 3 course; you'll likely find it valuable and informative.
#   - question: Is this course hard?
#     answer: Not if you've taken the beginners course or you have at least a year of Scala experience. I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.

### Become a pro, still live on Scala 2.

Scala is a BEAST, but you already know that. This course taught 15000 Scala developers and transformed them into rockstars, now working at some of the best companies in the world.

Although this course was recently revamped and [re-recorded from the ground up on Scala 3](/courses/advanced-scala), but this course will continue to be live on Rock the JVM for as long as people still write Scala 2. In the meantime, here's what you get:

- 2000 LOC written on camera
- 13+ hours of HD video
- Takeaway slides
- Timeless Scala and functional programming skills
- Exclusive access to the private Rock the JVM community

### Skills you'll get

After this course, you'll be able to
