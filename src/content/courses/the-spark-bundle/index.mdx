description: "Learn big data with Apache Spark and Scala in this comprehensive bundle: batch, streaming, Spark optimization, performance tuning and more."
excerpt: <p>Take all of the above at a discount and you won't need another book, video or blog again. Enjoy a complete structured journey from zero to master in Apache Spark.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is this in total? Will I have time for it?
    answer: This series is roughly 25 hours in total, with lessons around 15-25 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focused work at one time. You can cover everything in <2 weeks if you're committed.
  - question: Does this really work?
    answer: Yes. Also, that's not my answer - it's what you hear about all the Rock the JVM material from thousands of people now working at Apple, UniCredit, Adobe, Uber and other successful companies and teams around the world.
  - question: Is it hard?
    answer: No. It just grows in difficulty in time, proportional to your work. I only require that you've programmed before in some other language and you know some general fundamentals. At the end of the series, you will look back to the advanced pieces and you'll go like "Huh. That would have been pretty tough if I tried that on my own."
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: What if I don't like it?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
  - question: I've already enrolled in some of the courses, but I want to take this bundle. Can I pay the difference?
    answer: Of course. I don't want you to pay for the same thing twice. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with a proof of all your purchases and I'll create a discount for you to offset what you paid.

    ### Crunch that data.

    You probably know already: Spark is one of the most powerful big data crunching tools, one of the most extensible and well maintained, [one of the most loved](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-other-frameworks-libraries-and-tools), and used by thousands of developers, teams, companies and organizations. It's 100x faster than the previous Map-Reduce paradigm, and it just works.

    Spark has seen huge demand in recent years, has [some of the best-paid engineering positions](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=Apache_Spark/Salary), and is just plain fun. This series is for Scala programmers who need to crunch big data with Spark, and need a clear path to mastering it.

    This bundle contains

    - <p>100+ live runnable examples</p>
    - <p>100+ exercises with solutions</p>
    - <p>3 real-life projects crunching either one the largest public datasets available, or live data in real time</p>
    - <p>4000+ lines of code written from scratch, more than most engineers write in months</p>
    - <p>(I have exactly 4109 lines on camera, which I'll share with you 100%)</p>
    - <p>Access to a growing private community on Slack</p>
    - <p>~25 hours of HD content (soon downloadable)</p>
    - <p>(Soon) takeaway slides</p>
    - <p>All updates and additional material for free, for life</p>

    ### "Show me the path."

    If you came here thinking, "I want to learn Spark, just show me a step-by-step way to do it, and I'll follow", this is it. There's little else for me to say. More than 2000 people have taken this journey and they speak:

    *This is the connecting dots video series for get over all concepts of Spark process which is extremely useful for the peoples just started learning spark. Thank you Daniel*
    (Anoop C., March 11, 2020)

    There are hundreds of reviews like that, and that's on Udemy. The version you're looking at is even better and with exclusive new material. **You will crunch BILLIONS of records on an Amazon cluster, do sentiment analysis on live Twitter data, integrate Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Akka Streams, and whatever your heart desires.**

    This path is literally what you need to follow to be good at Spark.
