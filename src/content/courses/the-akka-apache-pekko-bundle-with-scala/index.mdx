description: Everything you need to become an expert Akka/Apache Pekko developer. Master Akka/Apache Pekko with Scala and distributed JVM applications through clear lessons, practical exercises, and a smooth learning curve. Ideal for those with some programming experience, this bundle will take you from zero to hero.
excerpt: "<p>Become a Akka/Apache Pekko and distributed JVM applications expert <strong>from scratch</strong> with our <strong>all-inclusive course bundle</strong>: master everything you need with Scala in one complete package, at a discount</p>"
# faqs:
#   - question: Does this really work?
# answer: Yes, it does. Also, that's not my answer - it's what you hear about all the Rock the JVM material from thousands of people now working at Apple, UniCredit, Adobe, Uber and other successful companies and teams around the world.
#   - question: Is it hard?
# answer: It can be if you try this on your own, but no. All you need is some essential Scala skills. Otherwise, I've designed the series so that it just grows in difficulty in time, proportional to your work. I only require that you've programmed before in some other language and you know some general fundamentals. At the end of the series, you will look back to the advanced pieces and you'll go like "Huh. That would have been pretty tough if I tried that on my own."

    ### Think distributed systems differently.

    You know Akka and the actor model - one of the most powerful abstractions of concurrent programming we've had, even though it's [not new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)#%22Let_it_Crash%22_coding_style). Use actors instead of threads and locks, go immortal with event sourcing, reactive with streams, distribute everything with remoting and clustering, build large scale distributed systems like they did all over the place.

    **This series is for the Scala programmer who needs to work with Akka and needs a clear path to mastering it.** Rock the JVM has - to my knowledge, and I've searched way past the second page on Google - the only such path in existence.

    This bundle contains

    - 300+ live runnable examples
    - 150+ exercises with solutions
    - 10000+ lines of code written from scratch, more than most engineers push in a year
    - (I have exactly 10423 lines on camera, which I'll share with you 100%)
    - Access to a growing private community on Slack
    - ~50 hours of HD content (soon downloadable)
    - (Soon) takeaway slides
    - All updates and additional material for free, for life

    ### "Show me the path."

    If you came here thinking, "I want to learn Akka, just show me a step-by-step way to do it, and I'll follow", this is it. There's little else for me to say. More than 4000 people have taken this journey and they speak:

    *I've heard guys working years with scala saying that the Akka Streams library is so complex that only the lightbend folks that write it can use it. I've given it a try in the past, but after going beyond basic sources, sinks and flow i was like WTF!!. Daniel once again nails it, explains so nicely every single details, and spreads some light into such a hard topic. This course is so advanced that you will probably have to go through it 2 or more times, but after you do, daniel presents everything so nicely that you will definetely be a master of Akka Streams. Honestly Daniel is like my Scala Guru.*

    *The course is awesome!! As expected of course from Daniel, a great teacher going in depth for all concepts and explaining the WHYs and not just the HOWs. Currently on my journey to become a true master of the Akka world, can't wait to continue with the rest of the series. Thanks for helping us rock Daniel!!*
    (Kyriakos T. on the Akka series, Jan. 2020)

    There are >1000 reviews like that, and that's on Udemy. The version you're looking at is even better and with exclusive new material.

    This path is literally what you need to follow to be good at Akka, and it's the only series on the web of this scale and complexity.
