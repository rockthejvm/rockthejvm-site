faqs:
  - question: Can I get a refund if I'm unhappy with this bundle?
    answer: In the absolutely remote chance that you are - just email me and you'll have your money back.
  - question: Is this the same as a lifetime membership?
    answer: You get the included courses for life, that's for sure. It's just that this bundle doesn't contain any future courses, unlike the monthly/yearly membership.
  - question: What about updates?
    answer: All the included courses come with free updates, so you'll get all of them for free.
  - question: (fake bragging question) Just how much content am I looking at?
    answer: 320+ hours of content, 60000 lines of code from scratch, hundreds of lessons and hundreds of live examples and exercises. Plus takeaway slides.
  - question: Does this include access to the private Rock the JVM community?
    answer: You bet!
  - question: I bought a course at X dollars and I'm thinking about getting this bundle. Do you offer discounts?
    answer: This pack already comes at an outrageous price, so it doesn't have additional discounts. "Discount" is its middle name, for crying out loud ðŸ˜„

With this bundle, you won't need to take another learning product for at least another year, because you'll have more than enough:

- mastery of Scala
- mastery of Kotlin
- giant project-based courses that you can use to start a startup: ZIO & Typelevel Rite of Passage
- data engineering mastery with Spark
- functional programming skills of the top 1%
- distributed systems mastery with Akka/Apache Pekko
- data streaming with Apache Flink

In short, in this bundle you'll have more STRUCTURED learning than you'll need for at least a few different careers, and each course individually has the potential to take you one level up, whether that's a promotion, a career shift, or a startup.

This is the single best investment you can make this year. The ROI is >100% the moment you step into your job after one of these courses, and the sky is the limit with what you can achieve.

And in the one in a trillion chance you don't like it, you get your money back.

What are you waiting for?
