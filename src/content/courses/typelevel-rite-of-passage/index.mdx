description: Learn how to build full-stack Scala 3 applications with the Typelevel stack in this long-form online course.
excerpt: <p>The experience of a software engineer. Use the Typelevel stack to <strong>build your own full-stack product in Scala 3</strong>, with credit card checkout, emails, the real deal. The app we build is live <a href="https://jobs.rockthejvm.com">here</a>.</p>
faqs:
  - question: Looks cool, but I would have used ______ effect library with ______ for frontend and ______ for backend! WAY BETTER! YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
    answer: Riccardo and I have spent close to a year evaluating many different setups, boilerplates, libraries and approaches to building a full stack application with Typelevel. There are probably many great options, but I found this set of technologies to be the best fit - they are all well supported, actively developed and most importantly are the tech that I'd reach for when building a new application. Heck, I did build a new app with this stack. It's important to note here that this course isn't just teaching you how to hook together a few libs - you are learning to think in and build full stack Scala 3 applications. The ideas behind this course transcend all libraries!
  - question: OMG this course is expensive!
    answer: Compared to the amount of TIME you'll spend grinding these lessons and experience on your own, it's nothing - take a developer's daily pay in your country (any country), multiply that by an honest number of days you'll need to build such an app alone, then come back to this page. Not to mention you'll know how to build an app that can make your money back!
  - question: Is this course included with the membership?
    answer: "No ðŸ˜­ but hear me out. This course is at a completely different level compared to everything that's in the membership, so it'll stay separate. BUT! All members will have a massive discount to this course under their account. So the benefits of being a member will only increase with time, regardless of what I create next. How to claim the discount: click on the membership card in the course dashboard, and you'll see the code inside."
  - question: Do you give a certificate?
    answer: Sure do! You'll automatically get a certificate which you can export and use this to get reimbursed or land your dream Scala job. The real reward, though, is when you make your own app with the ideas you learned in this course!
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Yep! After you enroll, you'll automatically get a tax-compliant receipt which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: What can I do with the code? Can I put it on GitHub?
    answer: It's your code, so go nuts! I just ask that you don't create your own course teaching with this app or launch your own identical jobs platform so you can then say Rock the JVM sucks ðŸ˜­. You can use the code in this course as a portfolio project to get a job, a starting point to build your next trillion$ startup with Scala, a quick prototype to impress your boss and convince them to use Scala. In any case, if you want to take something from the course, take the ideas, they're worth far more than the code.
  - question: Is the Typelevel stack difficult?
    answer: It's not rocket science, but it's not trivial either. The learning curve is steep if you're doing it on your own. Materials are scarce. So I wanted to compress your learning time and hard-earned lessons into one comprehensive experience.
  - question: What if I'm not happy with the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: I'm just getting started with Scala. Can I take this course?
    answer: "Short answer: probably not. Longer answer: we have some Scala starter code at the beginning of the course, but that won't replace the kind of experience we need for this course. I recommend you check out theï»¿ Scala essentials and advanced courses first before coming back here."
  - question: Where did you get the banner art for the course?
    answer: The banner was created by the amazing @fellownoodle. She made the banner specifically for this Rite of Passage.

    ### Build a Full-Stack Application with Scala 3 and the Typelevel Stack

    Just as Scala has transformed the way we build applications with functional programming, the Typelevel stack is changing how we build strong, testable and provably correct APIs.

    With a focus on **functional Scala** and a **real world application**, this course is a start-to-finish way to learn Full Stack Scala 3 with Cats, Cats Effect and friends.

    Join me as I show you how to build a full stack jobs platform with the latest evolution of Scala and functional libraries.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="question">
    Typelevel is a set of Scala libraries for building robust, scalable and high-performance applications.

    Say what?

    The foundation for Typelevel is pure functional programming and Scala's unmatched type system. With these tools, we can let the Scala compiler work in our favor, so we can write **more modular code** and in the end become **more productive and happier** as developers.

    **We will use all major Typelevel tools and libraries in this course.**

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature1">
    ### What will you build?
    Together we will build the [Rock the JVM Jobs Board](https://jobs.rockthejvm.com/), a full stack online jobs platform with **credit card integration.** Users can create and **manage their account, post and view jobs,** and **apply** for them.

    We will build the application from scratch, using a decoupled layered architecture on the backend, and an **Elm-like** architecture on the frontend with **ScalaJS.**

    The app includes many server-side bits including authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards. We have almost complete **test coverage** in the backend, and we develop some core modules with **test-driven development (TDD).**

    The frontend is built as a **single-page application,** organized for for scalability if you want to add new pages or functional components.

    For a full list of topics covered, see below.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature2">
    ### "Real-Life" means Real-LIVE
    I want to put my code where my mouth is.

    The application that you learn to build in this course is fully deployed and live here:

    [jobs.rockthejvm.com](https://jobs.rockthejvm.com/)

    Yes, it's **a real jobs platform that I will personally use** for my students at Rock the JVM!

    If you're a company and want to promote your jobs to the Rock the JVM community, **go ahead and use it!**

    And before you ask: yes, I'll teach you to do EVERYTHING from an empty dir to deploying on your own domain.

    This isn't even a "project-based" course. You will learn to build a **full-blown product** that people can use and pay for. You can build your startup with what you learn in this course.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="feature3">
    ### Who Is This Course For?
    Scala developers who want to expand their Scala skills with a full-blown product as a full-stack application.

    You should be comfortable writing any sort of Scala code, as we don't go over the Scala fundamentals. The [beginner](https://rockthejvm.com/p/scala) and [advanced](https://rockthejvm.com/p/advanced-scala) Scala courses focus on the language.

    You should already be familiar with [Cats](https://rockthejvm.com/p/cats) and [Cats Effect](https://rockthejvm.com/p/cats-effect). We'll do a round of recap at the beginning of the course, but we'll focus more on the project.

    The frontend is written in ScalaJS with Tyrian. Any experience with them is nice, but 100% not needed.

    To sum up, this course is for
    - anyone looking for a complete end-to-end Scala project
    - backend developers looking to go full-stack on Scala
    - Scala developers looking to advance their skills and career
    - anyone who wants to get better at Scala, full-stack architecture or functional programming

    Not sure if it's for you? 100% money back if it's not a fit for you ðŸ’°

    In any case, don't be scared. We'll build something great together.

  <Fragment slot="feature4">
    ### 100% Practical

    This course is long so we waste no time. This screenshot shows you what you'll write.

    As with anything at Rock the JVM, this course is **hands-on.** We start by recapping the fundamentals of major Typelevel libraries (Cats, Cats Effect, Doobie, Http4s etc) and then we get started.

    We'll **build the project from scratch,** starting from a blank directory and from first principles. As our code becomes more complex, we will **modularize as necessary.**

    We will arrive at our decoupled layered architecture organically, without my imposing any style on you from the start. You will find it quite extensible and modular.

    A big chunk of the backend is written in **test-driven development** style. We also have chunks where we write tests after the implementation, so that you feel the difference first-hand. In any event, we do extensive testing and our app will be robust.

    As for the **frontend,** we will add ScalaJS support from scratch, then we'll start scaffolding our app for **scalability** so you can easily add a new page or stateful component.

    We will also design our **domain** in a careful way so that the frontend and backend share the same definitions, eliminating nasty bugs due to schema mismatches.

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="skills">
    ### Skills You'll Learn & Practice

    <p>In each video, we learn and implement a concept into our application. We'll sometimes use these repeatedly to solve new problems.</p>

    <p>Because we build a full-stack Scala application, this course covers a ton. Here are some of the things you can expect to learn:</p>

    - REST APIs
    - Authentication
    - Authorization with JWTs
    - Role-Based Access Control
