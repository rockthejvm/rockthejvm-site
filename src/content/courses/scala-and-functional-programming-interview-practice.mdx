description: Master data structures, algorithms and the functional programming mindset with Scala to nail every Scala interview.
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is a full 15 hours in length, with lessons 10-30 minutes each. For best effectiveness, I recommend going through at least one problem, start to finish, in one go.
  - question: What's a typical lesson like?
    answer: Every lesson starts with a problem statement. After I explain what the problem does, I will ask you to pause the video and tell you how much time you should take to try solving the problem yourself. After the break, I will walk you through a solution, including WHY I picked it, how to test it, and how efficient it is.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Most (wise) employers reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is the course hard?
    answer: The problems range from very easy to very hard. Some problems will take 5 minutes and 2 lines of code, some problems might take hours to figure out by yourself.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: In that case I want you to have your money back. Easy.
  - question: I really want to join but can't afford the course. What do I do?
    answer: For a while, I told everyone who could not afford the course to email me and I gave them discounts. But then I looked at the stats. Almost all the people who actually took the time and fully completed the course had paid for it in full. So I'm not offering discounts anymore. This is an investment in yourself, which will pay off 100x if you commit.
