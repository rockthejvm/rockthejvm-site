description: Become one of the best Kotlin developers. Learn the rare Kotlin skills in this hands-on, practical course.
faqs:
  - question: Does this course cover Android?
    answer: This is beyond Android - this course is 100% focused on Kotlin as a programming language, without caring which platform you're going to write code for.
  - question: How is a typical lesson like?
    answer: We generally create separate mini-applications where we'll explore a certain feature of the Kotlin language, with examples and exercises. Each lesson is about 20-30 mins long.
  - question: Is this advanced Kotlin course hard?
    answer: If you know your way around Kotlin basics (at the level of the Kotlin Essentials course), you should be fine. If this is your first time with Kotlin (or first time coding), I recommend you take the Kotlin Essentials course first.
  - question: Do you give a certificate?
    answer: Sure do! You'll automatically get a certificate which you can export and use this to get reimbursed or land your Kotlin job.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enroll, you'll automatically get a tax-compliant receipt which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: I'm just starting out with Kotlin. Should I take this course?
    answer: Probably not. The essentials course might be better for you.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Money back, easy ðŸ’° Only a handful of people ever asked for a refund on the entire site of 20+ courses, just to give you an idea.
  - question: Do you have any connection to JetBrains or the Kotlin Foundation?
    answer: Nope - this course is not affiliated with JetBrains (the creators of Kotlin), Google or the Kotlin Foundation. I hope they say good things about this course once they see it, though!
