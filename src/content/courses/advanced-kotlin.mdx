description: Become one of the best Kotlin developers. Learn the rare Kotlin skills in this hands-on, practical course.
excerpt: <p>Become a top Kotlin developer. Master Kotlin's type system and internals, and learn the rare skills and tools that will make you a senior engineer.</p>
faqs:
  - question: Does this course cover Android?
    answer: This is beyond Android - this course is 100% focused on Kotlin as a programming language, without caring which platform you're going to write code for.
  - question: How is a typical lesson like?
    answer: We generally create separate mini-applications where we'll explore a certain feature of the Kotlin language, with examples and exercises. Each lesson is about 20-30 mins long.
  - question: Is this advanced Kotlin course hard?
    answer: If you know your way around Kotlin basics (at the level of the Kotlin Essentials course), you should be fine. If this is your first time with Kotlin (or first time coding), I recommend you take the Kotlin Essentials course first.
  - question: Do you give a certificate?
    answer: Sure do! You'll automatically get a certificate which you can export and use this to get reimbursed or land your Kotlin job.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enroll, you'll automatically get a tax-compliant receipt which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: I'm just starting out with Kotlin. Should I take this course?
    answer: Probably not. The essentials course might be better for you.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Money back, easy ðŸ’° Only a handful of people ever asked for a refund on the entire site of 20+ courses, just to give you an idea.
  - question: Do you have any connection to JetBrains or the Kotlin Foundation?
    answer: Nope - this course is not affiliated with JetBrains (the creators of Kotlin), Google or the Kotlin Foundation. I hope they say good things about this course once they see it, though!

    ### Become a Kotlin pro.

    If you're on this page, Kotlin will need no introduction. You know the basics, and you've written your fair share of Kotlin in production for your projects, either personal or at work.

    Perhaps your codebase has become larger than you can manage, or you would like to become a senior developer, or need to write libraries and tools for other team members.

    For this, you need **deep knowledge** of Kotlin's type system and internals, so that you can create the best tools.

    **This course is for you.**

    ### Skills You'll Learn

    After this course, you'll be able to:
    - understand the most complex Kotlin features
    - contribute to complex codebases
    - write libraries and tools for other developers
    - use the Kotlin type system for generic, easily reusable code
    - write frameworks that generate or analyze other source code

    Skills you'll get:
      - Kotlin type system mastery
      - OOP and FP (obviously)
      - Delegation and delegated properties
      - Using delegated properties in the standard library for specific contexts
      - Simplifying your types
      - Using advanced generics with variance
      - Understanding the compiler type-checker and variance positions
      - Kotlin internals proficiency
      - Contracts and compiler type checks
      - Inline functions and performance optimization
      - Avoiding JVM type erasure
      - Using reified types
      - Using reflection for manipulating and using code dynamically at runtime
      - Creating code generators and analyzers
      - Writing symbol processors
      - and much more, all with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.

    Plus some extra perks:
      - You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (1800+ LOC)
      - You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
      - You'll have access to the takeaway slides
