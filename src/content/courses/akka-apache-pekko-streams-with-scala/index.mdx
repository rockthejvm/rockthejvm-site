description: Learn Akka/Apache Pekko Streams with Scala and build reactive systems in this training course. Learn to implement data-rich systems at any scale, and write in 10 lines what other people write in 3000.

# faqs:
#   - question: Is this course hard?
#     answer: The hardest part is materialization, which is the most abstract and the most poorly understood concept in general, but we crack it with live code, exercises and very cute diagrams. Otherwise, I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
#   - question: I've never written Scala before. Should I take this course?
#     answer: You shouldn't. The course is for Scala programmers. Even though we do a bit of a recap at the beginning of the course to make sure we're all on the same page, that part is not enough to give you confident skills with Scala if you've never seen it before.
#   - question: I haven't worked with Akka or Pekko actors but I need Streams. Can I take this course?
#     answer: I... would not recommend it, BUT we don't talk actors _too_ much during the course, because the components hide away much of the (actor-based) implementation.
#   - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and threads and I'm curious about this actor model. Should I take this course?
#     answer: I don't recommend it. You should at least understand what threads are and how a normal computer can do multiple things at the same time. Otherwise a lot of what we talk about here is going to be overwhelming.
#   - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and I need Akka Streams (or I'm really curious about this). Should I take this course?
#     answer: Yes! This course is made for you.

    ### Plug and play.

    If you're reading this, I probably don't need to talk to you about the [reactive manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) or the [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) initiative. The terms are fancy but they lay down powerful principles, which have been proven and sent to production in many many many places. The idea is simple: water tap, pipes, sink, plug all and go. Except we call those data sources, transformers and data sinks.

    This course is for the Scala & Akka/Pekko developer who wants to write scalable asynchronous data pipelines quickly, also known as "fast data" or "reactive" systems.

    You'll learn to write fault-tolerant async data pipelines at scale, in as many lines as it takes Java to write "hello world".

    **This course is compatible with both Akka and Apache Pekko (the open-source version of Akka).**

    ### Oh yeah.
    You already know that Kotlin is such a game changer. It's very pragmatic, very flexible, has a powerful compiler, and allows you to write concise code that's easy for other people to understand.

    But there's far more to it.

    Beyond essentials OOP or functional principles, Kotlin has features that few developers have mastered. Kotlin's type system is among the best on the JVM, and the tools to manipulate types and code at runtime are top notch.

    With these tools, you can write **libraries, tools for other developers, frameworks for large codebases**, and much more.

    This is what you'll learn in this advanced Kotlin course.
