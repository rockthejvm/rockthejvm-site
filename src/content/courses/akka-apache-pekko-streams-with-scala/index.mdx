description: Learn Akka/Apache Pekko Streams with Scala and build reactive systems in this training course. Learn to implement data-rich systems at any scale, and write in 10 lines what other people write in 3000.
difficulty: advanced
excerpt: "<p>Harness the power of reactive streams using Akka/Apache Pekko Streams with Scala: learn to implement scalable, data-rich systems efficiently, writing in a few lines what takes others thousands to achieve</p>"
# faqs:
#   - question: Is this course hard?
#     answer: The hardest part is materialization, which is the most abstract and the most poorly understood concept in general, but we crack it with live code, exercises and very cute diagrams. Otherwise, I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
#   - question: I've never written Scala before. Should I take this course?
#     answer: You shouldn't. The course is for Scala programmers. Even though we do a bit of a recap at the beginning of the course to make sure we're all on the same page, that part is not enough to give you confident skills with Scala if you've never seen it before.
#   - question: I haven't worked with Akka or Pekko actors but I need Streams. Can I take this course?
#     answer: I... would not recommend it, BUT we don't talk actors _too_ much during the course, because the components hide away much of the (actor-based) implementation.
#   - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and threads and I'm curious about this actor model. Should I take this course?
#     answer: I don't recommend it. You should at least understand what threads are and how a normal computer can do multiple things at the same time. Otherwise a lot of what we talk about here is going to be overwhelming.
#   - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and I need Akka Streams (or I'm really curious about this). Should I take this course?
#     answer: Yes! This course is made for you.

### Plug and play.

If you're reading this, I probably don't need to talk to you about the [reactive manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) or the [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) initiative. The terms are fancy but they lay down powerful principles, which have been proven and sent to production in many many many places. The idea is simple: water tap, pipes, sink, plug all and go. Except we call those data sources, transformers and data sinks.

This course is for the Scala & Akka/Pekko developer who wants to write scalable asynchronous data pipelines quickly, also known as "fast data" or "reactive" systems.

You'll learn to write fault-tolerant async data pipelines at scale, in as many lines as it takes Java to write "hello world".

**This course is compatible with both Akka and Apache Pekko (the open-source version of Akka).**

### Oh yeah.
You already know that Kotlin is such a game changer. It's very pragmatic, very flexible, has a powerful compiler, and allows you to write concise code that's easy for other people to understand.

But there's far more to it.

Beyond essentials OOP or functional principles, Kotlin has features that few developers have mastered. Kotlin's type system is among the best on the JVM, and the tools to manipulate types and code at runtime are top notch.

With these tools, you can write **libraries, tools for other developers, frameworks for large codebases**, and much more.

This is what you'll learn in this advanced Kotlin course.

### After this course, you'll be able to:
- Use the principles of the reactive manifesto in your applications
- Read, transmit and process data with high performance, at scale, with streaming components
- Describe massive streams of any shape and size with the Graph DSL, without needing to care about concurrency
- Use backpressure to control the flow of data through your system
- Use streams materialization, a difficult concept understood only by the very best
- Use graph cycles in your streams to your advantage
- Create your own streaming components with as much control as you like
- Integrate Akka or Pekko Streams with normal actors
- Avoid concurrency pitfalls
- Circumvent cyclical streaming deadlocks
- Maintain data integrity in the face of disproportional demand or supply

### Plus some extra perks:

- You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (all 2100 lines of it)
- You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
- (Soon) you'll have access to the takeaway slides
- (Soon) you'll be able to download the videos for your offline view

### Skills you'll get:

- Reactive Streams and Akka or Pekko Streams principles
    - Understand what "reactive" means
    - Use streaming components
    - Understand and use stream materialization
    - Control the data flow in your streams with backpressure
    - Test Akka streams
- The Streams Graph DSL
    - Describe streaming architectures of any shapes and size
    - Create composite components and use them atomically in other graphs
    - Obtain materialized values from any streaminng graph
    - Use and control graph cycles
- Streams best practices
    - Integrate streams with Akka actors
    - Integrate streams with (general) external services
    - Reliably test Akka or Pekko Streams with the Akka Streams TestKit
    - Achieve fault-tolerance in your streams
- Advanced techniques with Akka or Pekko Streams used by the very best
    - Split data into parallelizable substreams
    - Manage Akka streams at runtime
    - Use the powerful GraphStage API to create your own components

all with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.
