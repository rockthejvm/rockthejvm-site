description: Learn ZIO 2.0 in this masterclass for pragmatic functional programming in Scala. An online course for Scala developers.
excerpt: <p>Learn to write powerful applications with parallelism, concurrency and pure functional programming with one of the hottest tools in the Scala ecosystem.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How long is the ZIO course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is a whole 13 hours in length, and we write 3000 lines of code from scratch. I recommend going through the course in sessions of at least 30 minutes each.
  - question: What does a typical lesson contain?
    answer: The course is hands-on, so most of the time will be spent writing code. I'll guide you every step of the way, explaining what each bit means. We'll also have some theoretical sections in the lessons as appropriate.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enroll, you'll automatically get a tax-compliant receipt which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: Is ZIO hard?
    answer: It's not rocket science, but it's not trivial either. The learning curve is steep if you're doing it on your own. Materials are scarce. That's why I made this course, to compress your learning time to just a couple of days, with a smooth progression and lots of practice.
  - question: What if I'm not happy with the course?
    answer: If you're not 100% happy with the course, I want you to have your money back. It's a risk-free investment.
  - question: Daniel, I can't afford the course. What do I do?
    answer: Check out the membership. It gives you access to everything on the site at an affordable price, and you'll be done with the course no problem.
  - question: I'm just getting started with Scala. Can I take this course?
    answer: "Short answer: probably not. Longer answer: we have some Scala starter code at the beginning of the course, but that won't replace the kind of experience we need for this course. I recommend you check out the Scala essentials and advanced courses first before coming back here."
  - question: Where did you get the banner art for the course?
    answer: I'm cheating a bit because this is a made-up FAQ, but it's an opportunity to credit freepik.com for the drawing I used for the banner. Needless to say the ZIO logo belongs to the ZIO creators. I'll just keep the Rock the JVM logo.
