  - question: Did you just say I can learn Kotlin in a couple of hours?
    answer: I did. I also created a similar Scala course a few years ago, which was successful, and Scala is more complex than Kotlin. If this course works (or doesn't), I'd love to hear your feedback at daniel@rockthejvm.com.

    ### Learn Kotlin in the time it takes to watch a movie.

    Kotlin is a super-powerful language. It runs on top of the JVM, has access to the entire Java ecosystem, allows you to think code in many ways, and allows you to write any kind of software for any kind of platform: JVM, server-side, mobile, web, even multiplatform all in the same project.

    But Kotlin is not the easiest language to master. There are many tricks and syntax sugars that seem quite magical, non-obvious constructs and expressions, and learning Kotlin on your own can take forever.

    But it doesn't need to be this way. You can learn fast with the right tools, the right selection of topics and the right sequencing so you can relate to them as you progress. This mini-course gives you that.

    In the time it takes for you to watch a movie, you will get a serious taste of what Kotlin looks like. With more hands-on practice than a 300-page book, this mini-course will show you what Kotlin is capable of, so that you can then dive as deep as you want.

    ### The most compact Kotlin crash course on the web.
    <p>Here are some stats about the course:</p>
    - <p>This course takes roughly 2 hours of watch time in total.</p>
    - <p>You will write roughly 500 lines of code.</p>
    - <p>You'll go through ~50 examples demonstrating concepts from very basic to pretty advanced.</p>
    <p>Once enrolled, you have access to the course for as long as Rock the JVM is a thing. You can watch this in an envening and get off your chair with Kotlin in your arsenal. You also have a GitHub repo with all the code I wrote on camera.</p>

    ### It's free
    **First, the course needs some programming background.** I will often refer to Java, C++, C, Python or JavaScript throughout the course so you can relate to the topics and "click" them in your head faster. If you've never coded before, this course is not for you.

    **Second, I will ask for your undivided attention.** As much as you give to your SO. Seriously, this course is not rushed (I hope), but it's compressed like a neutron star, with a new thing every 1-2 minutes. It will only be as effective as your focus and commitment throughout the videos.

    **If you like this course, I have an optional ask: share it.** Give this to your colleague, your friend, your dad, your dog, your grandma. Pass this on Twitter and mention me, put it on your LinkedIn or your favorite forum or wherever you think this can help people.
