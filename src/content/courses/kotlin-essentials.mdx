description: Become a Kotlin developer. Learn the fundamentals of Kotlin in this practical online course.
faqs:
  - question: Does this course cover Android?
    answer: Nope - this course is 100% focused on Kotlin as a programming language, without caring which platform you're going to write code for.
  - question: How is a typical lesson like?
    answer: "We generally create separate mini-applications where we'll explore a certain feature of the Kotlin language, with examples and exercises. Each lesson is about 10-20 mins long. We also have a mini-project: a command-line image processor, which can resize images and perform various effects (grayscale, blend modes, blurring, edge detection)."
  - question: Is this Kotlin course hard?
    answer: Not really. If you have some existing experience coding in another language, this course should be relaxing enough to have fun, but will give you a nice brain stretch. If you haven't programmed before, the course might be a bit tougher, simply because we skip the CS fundamentals. But don't stress about it! Ask in our private community if you ever get stuck, and we'll help.
  - question: Do you give a certificate?
    answer: Sure do! You'll automatically get a certificate which you can export and use this to get reimbursed or land your Kotlin job.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! After you enroll, you'll automatically get a tax-compliant receipt which you can use to reimburse this course with your employer.
  - question: I'm an advanced Kotlin user. Should I take this course?
    answer: Probably not. The advanced course might be better for you.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Money back, easy ðŸ’° Only a handful of people ever asked for a refund on the entire site of 20+ courses, just to give you an idea.
  - question: Do you have any connection to JetBrains or the Kotlin Foundation?
    answer: Nope - this course is not affiliated with JetBrains (the creators of Kotlin), Google or the Kotlin Foundation. I hope they say good things about this course once they see it, though!
