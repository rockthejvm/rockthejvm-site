description: The Akka/Pekko online course that teaches you to build distributed applications on the JVM.
difficulty: intermediate
excerpt: <p>Enough threads and locks and headaches. Meet the <strong>Actor Model</strong>. Dive into a better way of thinking concurrent and distributed code.</p> # TODO: Also with classic actors.
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is ~10 hours in length, with lectures 15-30 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focused learning at one time.
  - question: How is a usual lesson like?
    answer: We focus on code, so we'll spend most of our time in the dev environment. In the lessons where new concepts are introduced, I'll add some diagrams or animations to make it crystal clear. Many lessons will also contain exercises, so you can pause the video and try them, and I show you a proposed solution every time.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is this course hard?
    answer: I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: I've never written Scala before. Should I take this course?
    answer: Not really. The course is for Scala programmers. Even though we do a bit of a recap at the beginning of the course to make sure we're all on the same page, that part is not enough to give you confident skills with Scala if you've never seen it before.
  - question: I don't know how threads work. Should I take this course?
    answer: Not recommended. You should at least understand what threads are and how a normal computer can do multiple things at the same time.
  - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and threads and I'm curious about this actor model. Should I take this course?
    answer: Yes! This course is made for you.
  - question: Daniel, I want to join but I can't afford it.
    answer: Check out the Rock the JVM Membership (https://rockthejvm.com/p/membership) for the cheapest option.
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 0.1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.

    ### Think concurrency differently.

    If you're reading this, you've probably heard about Akka, Pekko or the actor model. It's one of the most powerful abstractions of concurrent programming we've had, even though it's [not new](https://rockthejvm.com/p/akka-essentials#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20reading,powered%20by%20Akka.). No more creating threads, no more locking, double-locking, deadlocks and concurrency problems. With actors, you can write heavily concurrent and distributed systems quickly, without the usual headaches. As such, massively parallel and distributed backends all over the place are powered by Akka.

    This course is for the Scala developer willing to tap into the actor model and a new way of thinking parallel and distributed code.

    **The course fully supports Akka (from Lightbend) as well as Pekko, the open-source version of Akka.**

    ### Main benefits of Akka or Pekko
    - <p>Write massively parallel and distributed applications more quickly</p>
    - <p>Add resilience and fault tolerance to your applications without any great fuss</p>
    - <p>Write code with an easy mental model you can relate to</p>
    - <p>Easily test parallel apps, which are notoriously hard to test</p>

    ### Write parallel code with actors instead of threads and locks
    - <p>Write parallel code with actors instead of threads and locks</p>
    - <p>Manage actors in hierarchies</p>
    - <p>Adopt the "let it crash" philosophy with your applications</p>
    - <p>Configure Akka or Pekko for anything</p>
    - <p>Test concurrent applications with actors</p>
    - <p>Parallelize and delegate tasks to actors</p>
    - <p>Use the best practices in working with the actor model</p>

    - <p>Plus some extra perks:</p>
      - <p>You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (all 2200+ lines of it)</p>
      - <p>You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities</p>
      - <p>You'll have access to the takeaway slides</p>

    ### Skills you'll get:

    - <p>Work with actors instead of threads</p>
      - <p>Understand the thread model limitations</p>
