# faqs:
#   - question: Is Spark hard to learn?
# answer: It can be, if you're trying to learn on your own, which is why I've created this dedicated Spark course. The course was designed to give you a challenge so you're not bored, but not so much that you flip the table in anger. In case you struggle, we have a community willing to help, and I'm responsive for questions!
#   - question: I'm an advanced user of Spark with Scala. Should I take this course?
# answer: Probably not, unless you want a structured refresher.
#   - question: I have very little experience with Scala (if any). Should I take this course?
# answer: I don't recommend it. You should take the Scala beginners course (at least) first, before you learn Spark.

### Become a professional.

You probably know by now: Spark is the most popular computing engine for big data, the most maintained, and with a proven track record of performance. It's 100 times faster than the old MapReduce paradigm, and can easily be extended with machine learning and streaming capabilities, and much more.

If you're dealing with large amounts of data, learning Spark is a must.

The demand for Spark has skyrocketed, and companies are struggling to fill their Data Scientist positions. Scala and Spark are two of the best paying technologies in the field. Forget the reported 120k salaries on PayScale and StackOverflow. I regularly see engineers and data scientists working for 150k+ per year, or charging thousands a day for consulting.

However you take it, learning Spark will be a game changer for your career, if you choose. And this course will help you get those skills. Join this Spark Big Data online course and learn by writing code.

### Work with real big data.

At the end of the course, we will dive into one of the biggest datasets publicly available and we'll put everything that we've learned to the test. Unlike every other material on the web (free or paid), this Spark course is the only place where you can really practice big data.

Everyone else runs a Spark job on one million records in a 20MB dataset. Why would you need Spark for that?

We do 1.4 BILLION car trips in a 400GB dataset. You don't fit that into most computers. That's the definition of big data.

This will be your true exercise to practice Spark with Scala. At the end of the project, we gather data insights worth millions of dollars for the company you're looking to help, and tens of thousands for you as a consultant and data scientist.

### Take the proven path

As with the other Rock the JVM courses, this Spark and Big Data Essentials course will take you through a battle-tested path to Spark proficiency as a data scientist and engineer.

As always, I've:

- Deconstructed the complexity of Spark in bite-sized chunks that you can practice in isolation
- Selected the essential concepts and exercises with the appropriate complexity
- Sequenced the topics in increasing order of difficulty so that they "click" along the way
- Applied everything in live code

### Skills you'll get

In short, you'll be a productive Spark developer and you can become a data engineer.

- You'll know how to work with DataFrames for Spark jobs of any complexity
- You'll be able to integrate any data source with Spark, and you'll know how to configure them
- You'll be able to perform
  - DataFrame transformations
  - Aggregations and data statistics
  - Joins
  - Unions
  - Arbitrary transformations with Datasets
- You'll know how to process absent values
- You'll understand what data cleanup means and how to do it
- You'll be able to deconstruct complex types like structures and arrays
- You'll be able to manage type safety with DataFrames and Datasets
- You'll understand Spark internals and run arbitrary Scala code wit hRDDs
- You'll know how Spark works in a cluster
- You'll deploy your own Spark apps on Amazon
- You'll run your own data engineering projects

**After this course, you'll be able to process data in any way you need using Spark.**

But most importantly, you'll develop timeless skills that you'll carry with you for your entire career, regardless of which data streaming tool you'll end up using:

- You'll deeply understand the practical benefits of big data in general
- You'll be able to work with Spark for any job
- You'll know how to pick the right tool or the right API levels
