description: Learn Akka Streams and build reactive systems in this training course. Learn to implement data-rich systems at any scale, and write in 10 lines what other people write in 3000.
faqs:
  - question: How long is the course? Will I have time for it?
    answer: The course is ~8 hours in length, with lectures around 20-30 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focused learning at one time.
  - question: How is a typical lesson like?
    answer: Code is king, and we write it from scratch (all 1500+ lines of it). In a typical lesson I'll explain some concepts, either briefly on a diagram or directly in the code. We then run live examples, and usually I'll finish the lesson with some exercises, which I then solve on camera after you've tried them yourself.
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: Is this course hard?
    answer: The hardest part is materialization, which is the most abstract and the most poorly understood concept in general, but we crack it with live code, exercises and very cute diagrams. Otherwise, I've designed the course to give you a challenge, but not too much that it becomes frustrating. In case you struggle with something, we have a whole group on Slack for discussions, and I'm responsive.
  - question: I've never written Scala before. Should I take this course?
    answer: You shouldn't. The course is for Scala programmers. Even though we do a bit of a recap at the beginning of the course to make sure we're all on the same page, that part is not enough to give you confident skills with Scala if you've never seen it before.
  - question: I haven't worked with Akka or Pekko actors but I need Streams. Can I take this course?
    answer: I... would not recommend it, BUT we don't talk actors _too_ much during the course, because the components hide away much of the (actor-based) implementation.
  - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and threads and I'm curious about this actor model. Should I take this course?
    answer: I don't recommend it. You should at least understand what threads are and how a normal computer can do multiple things at the same time. Otherwise a lot of what we talk about here is going to be overwhelming.
  - question: I'm comfortable with Scala and I need Akka Streams (or I'm really curious about this). Should I take this course?
    answer: Yes! This course is made for you.
  - question: Daniel, I want to join but I can't afford it.
    answer: "For a while, I offered discounts for the Rock the JVM courses to whomever needed them. But then I looked at the stats: almost nobody who took them actually completed any course. The full-price students were 3x as likely to complete the course. So I'm not offering discounts anymore. This course will pay off if you commit. "
  - question: What if I don't like the course?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
