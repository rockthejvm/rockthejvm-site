faqs:
  - question: How long is this in total? Will I have time for it?
    answer: This series is roughly 25 hours in total, with lessons around 15-25 minutes each. I recommend at least 1 hour of focused work at one time. You can cover everything in <2 weeks if you're committed.
  - question: Does this really work?
    answer: Yes. Also, that's not my answer - it's what you hear about all the Rock the JVM material from thousands of people now working at Apple, UniCredit, Adobe, Uber and other successful companies and teams around the world.
  - question: Is it hard?
    answer: No. It just grows in difficulty in time, proportional to your work. I only require that you've programmed before in some other language and you know some general fundamentals. At the end of the series, you will look back to the advanced pieces and you'll go like "Huh. That would have been pretty tough if I tried that on my own."
  - question: Can I expense this at my company?
    answer: Of course! You'll get a detailed receipt with your purchase, including VAT (if applicable to you), which you can take to your employer to reimburse. Most (wise) companies will reimburse courses like this.
  - question: What if I don't like it?
    answer: Then I want to give your money back. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with your receipt, and I will refund you. Less than 1% of the Rock the JVM students have refunded a course, and the refund took less than 72 hours.
  - question: I've already enrolled in some of the courses, but I want to take this bundle. Can I pay the difference?
    answer: Of course. I don't want you to pay for the same thing twice. Email me at daniel@rockthejvm.com with a proof of all your purchases and I'll create a discount for you to offset what you paid.
