faqs:
  - question: I've already enrolled in some of the courses but want to take this bundle. Can I pay the difference?
    answer: Yes, you can. To avoid paying for the same content twice, contact me at rockthejvm.com/contact with proof of your previous purchases, and I'll provide a discount to cover the amount you've already paid.
  - question: I'm a senior developer and want to gift this bundle to some junior developers on my team. Can I audit this bundle?
    answer: Absolutely. Feel free to contact me at rockthejvm.com/contact for assistance.
