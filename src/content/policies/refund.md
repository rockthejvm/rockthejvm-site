title: Refund Policy
---

This policy governs the manner in which the School may refund purchases of courses, memberships or other products.

## Refundable Products

The products eligible for refunds are

- individual course purchases
- course bundles purchased as a single product

The products that are not eligible for refunds are

- team course licenses already allocated
- in-person or virtual training sessions
- recurrent memberships, be it monthly, yearly or with any other recurrence, regardless of how many payments were already made on the respective product

## Refund Procedure

To ask for a refund, [contact me](/contact) with the request and proof of purchase is enough. Depending on the situation, we may need additional information, required to process the refund request.

For refundable products, the refund amount is 100%.

The refunded amount may arrive by the same payment method as the original purchase if initiated within 30 days of purchase. If the request is initiated later than 30 days, we reserve the right to refund the amount by a different payment method. The time it takes for the funds to arrive in your account may vary due to external factors outside our control (payment methods, banks, and other factors), but are usually settled in less than 72 hours.

## The More Informal Version

I made Rock the JVM courses so that they can help you for the rest of your career, and I believe in their massive value to you. I'm targeting a desired ROI of _at least_ 100x, meaning if you buy a course worth $100, you can be sure to reap at least $10000 - in salary bumps, new jobs, maybe a startup, etc - with the skills you get inside.

So if for some reason, you find that a course is not for you, then I want to give you your money back. No 14-day refund policies with a 5-working-days email response time, not 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. Anytime.

Just [contact me](/contact) with your request, and it's done.

Memberships aren't refundable, though.

## Statistics

As of October 2024, the refund rate is less than 0.2% and every transaction is returned in less than 72 hours.
