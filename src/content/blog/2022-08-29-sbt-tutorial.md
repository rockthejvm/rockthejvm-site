_This article is brought to you by [Yadu Krishnan](https://github.com/yadavan88). He's a senior developer and constantly shares his passion for new languages, libraries and technologies. After his [long-form Slick tutorial](/slick), he's coming back with a new comprehensive introduction to SBT. Please enjoy!_

> _This tutorial complements Rock the JVM's premium [Scala masterclass](https://rockthejvm.com/p/the-scala-bundle), as you learn to set up and configure your Scala projects._

## 1. Introduction

SBT is the most popular build tool in the Scala ecosystem. SBT provides a very rich DSL to configure a Scala project. It is also extensible and supports customised plugins to enhance the project.

_(Daniel's note: SBT was originally an acronym for "simple build tool", but in time "simple" was replaced by "Scala". Should've been the other way around.)_

In this article we'll start an SBT project from scratch, and walk through essential SBT features you need.

## 2. Installation

There are multiple ways to install SBT:
- Manual Installation using the executable depending on the OS
- Using Coursier (https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
- Using IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA with SBT plugin

## 3. Basics of SBT
The core of SBT is a file named _build.sbt_. We can provide the needed configuration options within _build.sbt_.

### 3.1. Simplest SBT project

Let's look at a simple SBT project.
First, let's create an empty directory. We can then create an empty file within the directory as _build.sbt_.
In _build.sbt_, let's configure the Scala version of the project we are going to use:

```
scalaVersion := "2.13.8"
```
Note that SBT uses a special operator `:=` to assign the value.

Now, within the same directory, we can just start the SBT session by using the command `sbt`.
If everything is fine, this will load an SBT console successfully. We can execute the command `project` within the SBT console to verify and view the SBT project name.

Now, let's look at the other configuration options in the _build.sbt_ file.
We can provide a version for the project using the option `version` :
```
version := "1.0"
```
> Note that if any change is made to the _build.sbt_, we need to exit the existing SBT console and restart it for the changes to take effect. Alternatively, we use the SBT command `reload` to forcefully apply the changes.

We can set the name of the project using `name` and set an organisation for the project:
```
name := "rockthejvm"
organization := "com.rockthejvm"
```
Once we add a name to the project, SBT console will use the project name when we start the sbt. If it is not provided, the directory name is used instead.

### 3.2. Project Structure
A simple standard SBT project follows this structure (assume that the directory is _simpleProject_):

```
simpleProject
  |-- src
        |--- main/scala
        |--- test/scala
  |-- project
  |-- build.sbt
  ```

The Scala code and configurations are placed under _main_ or _test_ subdirectories. The _project_ is an optional directory that contains additional setting files needed for configuring the SBT project.

### 3.3. SBT versions
By default, SBT uses the installed SBT version for the projects. We can explicitly provide a specific version of the SBT. This is generally followed since there might be some breaking changes in the SBT releases and that  might unknowingly affect the entire project.
We can specify the SBT version for the project by using a file called as _build.properties_ under _project_ directory. We can mention the SBT version in the file as:
```
sbt.version=1.6.1
```
This will ensure that the project will use the SBT version as _1.6.1_ even though you might have installed another version of SBT in your machine.

### 3.4. Small Scala File and SBT Commands
Now, let's try to add a simple Scala file a main method. We will keep this file under the directory _src/main/scala_ with package as _com.rockthejvm_:

```
package com.rockthejvm
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, World!")
  }
}
```
Let's start the SBT console by executing the command `sbt` at the root of the project.
To compile the project, we can use _compile_ in the command. This will compile all the Scala files in the project and creates .class files. These files are kept under the directory _target_.
**SBT uses _incremental compilation_ to speed up the compilation. In this way, SBT will compile only the modified files, and re-use the previously compiled class files for the rest of the files.**
We can use the _clean_ command to remove all the generated class files.

We can run the application by using the command _run_. If we have multiple main classes in the project, SBT will show a prompt to select the main class to run.
In such case, we can use _runMain_ command by passing the class to run as:
```
runMain com.rockthejvm.Main
```

SBT also allows automatic compilation on any source file change. For that, we can start the compile command prefixed by `~` symbol within the SBT shell:
```
~compile
```
Now, SBT will track the source files and if any change is detected in the files, it will automatically recompile them.

## 4. Adding external Dependencies
So far, we have created Scala files without using any external dependencies. Now, let's look at how we can add additional libraries to our project. We can add the dependencies to our project by adding it to the settings _libraryDependencies_. SBT follows Ivy style format to define the dependencies as :
```
libraryDependencies += "com.lihaoyi" %% "fansi" % "0.4.0"
```

The method `+=` appends the provided library to the project dependencies.
An SBT dependency contains mainly 3 parts separated by % symbol.
The first part is the groupId of the library. The second part is the library name(artifactId) and the third part is the version of the library to be used. If you notice, you can see that a double percentage symbol (`%%`) is used between groupId and artifactId.
Scala is not binary compatible with different versions (such as 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 etc) except for Scala 3 series. Hence there are separate releases for each Scala libraries for each required versions. %% symbol ensures that SBT uses the same Scala version of library as the project.
That means SBT will automatically append the Scala version of the project before trying to find the library. The above dependency code is equivalent to the following format(note that single % is used, but artifact id contains the Scala major version):
```
libraryDependencies += "com.lihaoyi" % "fansi_2.13" % "0.4.0"
```

SBT also has triple % symbol (%%%), which is used to resolve ScalaJS libraries.

We can add multiple dependencies together by using ++= and Seq :
```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.lihaoyi" % "fansi_2.13" % "0.4.0"
  //Can add more dependencies here.
)
```

## 5. Scala files under project directory
SBT allows us to keep supporting files(i.e. non-source files, not part of the project "code" itself) for the build as Scala files. This helps to configure most of the required configurations in the known format of Scala classes. We can place the Scala files under the directory _project_.
Generally, depending on the project complexity, we keep various info (e.g. library dependencies) as object in these Scala files; they are accessible directly inside _build.sbt_. This is done so that we can keep and track all the dependencies in a single place, and access them in multiple parts (modules) of the project (more on modules shortly).

## 6. SBT Console
SBT also can start a REPL session within the project using the command `sbt console` or executing the command `console` within an SBT session. This will start up a REPL session just like the Scala REPL. However, the SBT console REPL will also load all the dependencies jars to the classpath so that we can directly import the classes and use them.
For example, let's try to use the fansi library in the SBT console.
We can then start up the SBT session by using `sbt` command. Then we can use the command _console_ within the SBT session to start a REPL.
Now, within this REPL, we have access to the methods from fansi. We can execute this code:
```
val redString: fansi.Str = fansi.Color.Red("Hello FAnsi String!")
```
_Console_ is a class from the fansi library to give color to the string.

In the same way, we can access any of the libraries within the project inside the REPL. This is really helpful in trying out small pieces of code within a project easily.

## 7. Running Tests
We normally write unit test cases and places them under the relevant package in the directory _src/test/scala_. Let's add _scalatest_ dependency and write a very simple test
```
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.2.13" % Test
```

Note the special identifier _Test_ after the last % symbol. Adding `Test` informs SBT that this library is needed only for the test cases and accessible under _src/test/scala_ directory. Whenever we make the packaged application from our project, these libraries are not added to the package as they are not needed at the application run time.
Instead of the identifier _Test_, we can also use the string `"test"` (wrapped in double quotes). However, this practice is discouraged as it doesn't provide type safety.

Now that we added the dependency, we can add a test file as:
```
package com.rockthejvm
import org.scalatest.funsuite.AnyFunSuite
class SimpleTest extends AnyFunSuite {
  test("comapare 2 strings ignoring case") {
    val calculatedString = "ROCKtheJVM"
    val expectedString = "rockthejvm"
    assert(calculatedString.toLowerCase == expectedString)
  }
}
```

Now, we can run the tests in the project using the command `test`. This will run all the tests that are available in the project under the _src/test/scala_ path.

It is also possible to run a subset of tests instead of all. For example, let's try to run only one test file. For this we will first start the SBT session. Then within the session we can run:
```
test:testOnly com.rockthejvm.SimpleTest
```
This will test only the _SimpleTest_ file. Note that we need to provide the full package path to resolve the class correctly.
We can also use a wildcard to make it easy to run the test:
```
test:testOnly *SimpleTest
```
This will run all the classes that ends with _SimpleTest_ within the entire project irrespective of the package.

So far, we started the session and then ran the test. We can do that directly from the terminal by using the command:
```
sbt test
```
This will start the SBT session and then run the test. However, we need to wrap the arguments after _sbt_ if there are some special characters are involved. For example, to run the test using wildcard, we need to use the command:
```
sbt 'test:testOnly *SimpleTest'
```
We can also use double quotes(") instead of single quotes('). This will ensure that all the arguments are passed to the SBT session at once.

We can compile only the test classes by using the command `test:compile` within sbt session.

## 8. Advanced configuration in _build.sbt_
In the previous section, we saw configurations like _name_, _organization_, etc. The values we set there are applicable for the entire project. SBT also lets us do some configurations per scope.
For example, by default SBT runs all the tests in parallel. If we somehow want to avoid that and run the tests in sequential way, we can set the config option for that. SBT uses the configuration key _parallelExecution_ for that and it is under the scope of Test.

So, in _build.sbt_, we can use the setting as:
```
Test / parallelExecution := false
```
This will set the value to false within scopes of test.

There are many such configurations which are configured using the scope. You can think of this something in the lines of _Test.parallelExecution_.

The list of different SBT scopes are `Test`, `IntegrationTest`, `RunTime`, `Compile`, `Provided`, `Optional`, `CompileInternal` and `ScalaTool` . So, we can set the configuration only for a particular scope. For example, we can set some configurations only for the scope `IntegrationTest` as:
```
IntegrationTest / testOptions += Tests.Argument("-verbosity", "1")
```

## 9. Multi Module Project
So far we have used a single module project. SBT allows to create multi-module project. This way, we can clearly separate different modules, but we can aggregate and combine different modules together to make a big project. Let's create a simple multi-module project first. For that, we can create a _build.sbt_ file as below within a new empty directory.

```
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.8"
ThisBuild / version := "1.0"
ThisBuild / name := "multi-module"
ThisBuild / organization := "com.rockthejvm"

lazy val module_1 = (project in file("module-1"))
lazy val module_2 = (project in file("module-2"))
```
Now, when we can save this file and hit _sbt_ command in the project directory. This will import the project based on the _build.sbt_ we created and will also create 2 subdirectories as _module-1_ and _module-2_ within the directory. The value provided in _file()_ is used to create the submodule name.

However, as of now there is no relationship between any of the modules. We can explicitly combine both the sub modules together and link to the parent project by adding a new line as below to the _build.sbt_:
```
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .aggregate(module_1, module_2)
```

In the same way, we can define dependencies between multiple submodules. We can make `module-2` to depend on `module-1` using `dependsOn` method:

```
lazy val module_2 = (project in file("module-2")).dependsOn(module_1)
```

We can also provide settings for each sub module differently using the `settings` method:

```
lazy val module_2 = (project in file("module-2")).settings(
  libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect" % "3.3.0"
)
```

## 10. Multi-Module Build Best Practice
We need to first identify and get clarity on different modules. Let's assume that we are building an application that contains database access, HTTP services, utilities etc.
Each of these can be separated as a  module. Then we can combine the different parts if one is dependent on another.

Some good practice principles:
- a single `build.sbt` file with all submodule information inside.
- common settings at the top (e.g. Scala version, org name)
- `ThisBuild` to ensure the settings are applied to the entire project including submodules
- variables for common library used across multiple sub-modules, applied as module `libraryDependencies`
- same for common settings, applied as `settings`

Below is a sample multi-module build.sbt:
```
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.8"
ThisBuild / version := "1.0"
ThisBuild / organization := "com.rockthejvm"

val catsVersion = "2.8.0"
val akkaVersion = "2.6.20"

lazy val core = project
  .in(file("core"))
  .settings(
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "com.typesafe"   % "config" % "1.4.2",
      "org.scalameta" %% "munit"  % "0.7.29" % Test
    )
  )

val commonDeps = Seq(
  "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.4.1"
)

lazy val compilerOptions = Seq(
  "-unchecked",
  "-feature",
  "-deprecation"
)

lazy val module_1 = project
  .in(file("module-1"))
  .settings(
    libraryDependencies ++= commonDeps ++ Seq(
      //add more dependencies which are needed only for this module
      "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-stream" % akkaVersion
    )
  )
  .dependsOn(core)

lazy val module_2 = project
  .in(file("module-2"))
  .settings(
    name := "module_2", //can be different from the file() name
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "org.typelevel" %% "cats-core" % catsVersion
      //add more dependencies which are needed only for this module
    )
  )
  .dependsOn(core)

lazy val root = project
  .in(file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "multi_module",
    publish / skip := true
  )
  .settings(
    scalacOptions ++= compilerOptions ++ Seq(
      "-Xfatal-warnings"
    )
  )
  .enablePlugins(BuildInfoPlugin) //Need to add the plugin details in plugins.sbt first. In this case `sbt-buildinfo`
  .aggregate(
    module_1,
    module_2
  )
```

## 11. Executing commands on each Module
Now that we are ready with a multi-module project, let's see how we can execute SBT commands module-wise.
At the root of the project, if we execute `sbt` it will start the SBT session. When we run the compile command, it will compile all the modules.

Once we are inside the SBT session, we can switch to a particular sub-module using:
```
project module_2
```
Now, when we compile, only this module will get compiled. But, if this module depends on another module, SBT will compile that module as well.

## 12. Plugins

One of the most important features of SBT is its support for plugins. Plugins help extend SBT with custom features which can be published and shared between multiple teams.
For handling plugins, a special file called as _plugins.sbt_ is used. This file is kept under the `project/` directory. Some common usages of plugins are:
 - packaging plugins to create jar, exe and other executables/deliverables
 - static code analysis plugins
 - code generation plugins

 Let's look at an example of _sbt-assembly_ plugin. This plugin helps to create an executable jar file from the SBT project.

 As a first step, we need to create _plugins.sbt_ and add the plugin definition to it:
 ```
 addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "1.2.0")
 ```
 As next step, we need to enable the required configurations needed for this plugin to work. To run a jar, we need to provide the main class to use. We can do that by providing the `mainClass` in the settings in _build.sbt_ for required module(sometimes, we need to create jar for a sub module, sometimes for the combined project)

 ```
assembly / mainClass := Some("com.rockthejvm.Module2Main"),
 ```

 Now we can use the SBT command `assembly`. This will create the jar file under the relevant project's target folder.
 Similar to `assembly/mainClass` there are many other configurations to customise the jar creation.

 This is just one of the plugins. There are many plugins available which can help improve the development experience.

## 13. Global plugins

 In the previous section, we added a plugin to the project. Sometimes, we might need to add some plugins that have nothing to do with the project itself. For example, there may be some plugin to publish the apps to an internal repository. This need not be kept in the git repo, instead can be shared across all the repositories.
 SBT allows to do this using global plugins.

 Instead of keeping the _plugins.sbt_ within the project, we can create the file in the _.sbt_ path.
 ```
 $HOME/.sbt/1.0/plugins
 ```
 When SBT starts, it will load all the plugins from the global path. For example, in our previous example, We can remove the _plugins.sbt_ from the _project_ directory and keep it in the above path. On reloading the project, it will still load the plugin, but from the global path instead.
 You can notice in the SBT startup logs with some similar logs like:
 ```
 [info] loading global plugins from /Users/username/.sbt/1.0/plugins
 ```

## 14. Resolvers
 So far, all the library dependencies and plugins are downloaded from the Maven Central repository. Sometimes, we need to use other third-party repository for downloading libraries/plugins. To do that, we can provide resolvers in the _.sbt_ files.
 ```
resolvers += Resolver.url("my-test-repo", url("https://example.org/repo-releases/"))
 ```
Now, apart from Maven Central, SBT will also look at the provided location for libraries.
We can also add resolvers as the local maven directory. For that, we can use the resolver setting as:
 ```
resolvers += Resolver.mavenLocal
```
This will look for the dependencies in the `.m2` directory.

Apart from Maven Central, we can also configure other services to resolve the libraries. For example, to use a Sonatype repo, we can use:
```
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases")
```
We can also provide custom locations for the resolvers. For example, we can configure a customised central location for the repositories as:
```
resolvers += Resolver.url("my-company-repo", url("https://mycompany.org/repo-releases/"))
```

Similarly, we can add any number of resolvers.
But note that as the number of resolvers increases, SBT might take more time to start as it might need to look at all the configured repositories before failing.

## 15. Custom Tasks
Another powerful feature of SBT is the ability to create custom tasks. Apart from the built-in task keys, we  can easily create new ones. For example, we can create a custom task to do some particular operation.

For example, let's create a task which will just print some text to console. We can extend this to any complex functionality in the same way.

For that, we can create a Scala file which does the printing logic and keep this file under _project_ directory:
```
object CustomTaskPrinter {
  def print() = {
    println("Rock the SBT custom task is here....")
  }
}

```
Next, we can define a custom task in the _build.sbt_ file as:
```
lazy val printerTask = taskKey[Unit]("Simple custom task")
```
The code `taskKey[Unit]` mentions that the task does an action and just returns with a Unit type.

The custom command will be `printerTask`.
Now, we can define the logic of the custom task in the _build.sbt_ again:
```
printerTask := {
    CustomTaskPrinter.print()
}
```

After this, we can reload SBT and execute the command `printerTask`. This will print the simple message we created before into the console.

Now, let's create another task to generate a string uuid value:

```
lazy val uuidStringTask = taskKey[String]("Generate string uuid task")
uuidStringTask := {
    StringTask.strTask()
}
```
We will implement the  StringTask as below:
```
object StringTask {
  def strTask(): String = {
    UUID.randomUUID().toString()
  }
}
```

Now we can use this task within previously created `printerTask` and access the UUID generated in the other  task. Let's modify the printerTask as
```
printerTask := {
    val uuid = uuidStringTask.value
    println("Generated uuid is : "+uuid)
    CustomTaskPrinter.print()
}
```
Note that, we used `uuidStringTas.value`. This value method takes the value from the setting and assign to the val uuid.

Now, when we run the command `printerTask`, it will first generate the UUID and then execute printerTask.

So far, we have created custom tasks. Now, let's look at custom settings. Before that, let's understand the difference  between a task and a setting.
An SBT task is something which can be invoked and executed each time. You can think of it like `def` in Scala.
Whereas, a setting is evaluated at the start of SBT session and after that it is memoized. It is like `val` in Scala.
In the similar way, we can create a setting. The only difference is that instead of `taskKey` we will use `settingKey` to define a setting:
```
lazy val uuidStringSetting = settingKey[String]("Generate string uuid task")
uuidStringSetting := {
    val uuid = StringTask.strTask()
    println("Evaluating settings... "+uuid)
    uuid
}
```
Now, to see the difference we can modify our previous printertask as:
```
printerTask := {
    val uuid = uuidStringTask.value
    println("Generated uuid from task:"+uuid)
    val uuidSetting = uuidStringSetting.value
    println("Generated uuid from setting:"+uuidSetting)
    CustomTaskPrinter.print()
}
```

Now, when we execute `printerTask`, notice the generated uuid. From task, each time a new UUID value is generated. But from setting, it will print the same value each time. Also, when you start the SBT session, immediately we can see the print statement `Evaluating settings...` with the same uuid.

## 16. Command Alias
Another advaced feature SBT supports is the ability to set aliases. This is similar to the alias we create on unix based OSs.

```
addCommandAlias("ci", ";clean; compile;test; assembly;")
```

Now, in SBT console, we can execute just `ci`. This will automatically execute the configured commands in the order it is defined in the alias _ci_

## 17. Giter Templates
SBT supports quick project bootstrap using giter(g8) templates. We can just execute the command `sbt new <template>` to create a new project based on the template.
By default, we can only use the templates available under the official g8 repo. However, we can also point to any custom g8 GitHub path to create the project from that template.

## 18. Cross Build between different Scala versions
Scala releases are not binary compatible with each other(except the Scala 3 series). That means, we need to rebuild a library in all the supported versions for the users to use it.
Doing this manually is not an easy step. SBT tries to make this easier by providing a feature to cross build between different versions.
To support multiple versions, we can provide the settings as:
```
val scala212 = "2.12.16"
val scala213 = "2.13.5"
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := scala212
lazy val crossproject = (project in file("crossproject"))
  .settings(
    crossScalaVersions := List(scala212, scala213),
    // other settings
  )
```

Note that, we have mentioned the default version for this project as Scala 2.12 using `ThisBuild/scalaVersion`. So when we compile, it will use Scala 2.12. Since we have given the `crossScalaVersions`, we can ask SBT to compile in all supported versions.
To do that, we need to add the symbol `+` before SBT command:
```
+ compile
```
When we publish our library, we can use `+ publish` command. This will ensure that all the supported versions of the library are published.

## 19. SBT Advanced Configurations and Options
SBT has many configuration options and argument passing on startup. Let's look at some of the important ones.

### 19.1. Check SBT Version
To check which version of SBT we are using, we can run the command:
```
sbt --version
```

### 19.2. View Applied SBT Options
We can view all the applied options to SBT using the debug command.
```
sbt --debug
```
This will show a list of arguments and options applied to SBT on startup. This is very useful in identifying if the correct parameters are applied or not.

Or we can use  `sbt -v` which will also provide more information related to passed arguments, but not all debug logs.

### 19.3. Passing Arguments on SBT Start
We can provide jvm arguments on SBT startup. For example, if we want to increase the heap memory of the SBT process, we can start the SBT with the parameter:
```
sbt -v -J-Xmx3600m
```
### 19.4. SBT Command Alias With JVM Arguments
We have seen before how to create SBT command aliases. We can create alias with passing jvm arguments.
However, we need to make sure that `fork := true` is set in _build.sbt_. This setting will ensure that SBT will start a forked jvm and apply the settings.
Without a fork JVM, the jvm parameters we pass are not considered by the SBT.

Let's see how to do that.
Let's add the following line to _build.sbt_ after adding fork:
```
addCommandAlias(
  "runSpecial",
  "; set ThisBuild/javaOptions += \"-Dport=4567\"; run"
)
```
Then, we will update the Main class to read this property and print it:
```
val portValue = Option(System.getProperty("port"))
println("PORT value from argument is: "+portValue)
```

Next, we need to restart SBT to get these changes to effect. Then run the command `runSpecial`. This will print the passed javaOptions.

If we want to pass multiple javaOptions, we need to use a Seq as:
```scala
addCommandAlias(
  "runSpecial2",
  "; set ThisBuild/javaOptions ++= Seq(\"-Dport=4567\", \"-Duser=rockthejvm\"); run"
)
```

Now when we run `runSpecial`, the value for `user` will be None. But when we run `runSpecial2`, it will have the value for `user` as "rockthejvm".

## 20. Conclusion
In this blog, we looked at SBT and its different components and functionalities. SBT has still more features which we haven't covered here. However, it is easy to explore more features once the basics are understood.
