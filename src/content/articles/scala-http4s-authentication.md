> Hey, it's Daniel here. You're reading a big article about the Http4s library.
> Http4s is one of the most powerful libraries in the Scala ecosystem, and it's part of the Typelevel stack. If you want to master the Typelevel Scala libraries with real-life practice, check out the [Typelevel Rite of Passage](https://rockthejvm.com/p/typelevel-rite-of-passage) course, a full-stack project-based course. It's my biggest and most jam-packed course yet.

## 1. Introduction

As a backend developer, authentication is a topic you will encounter numerous times in your career. With numerous authentication methods available, it becomes a challenge not only to choose but also to implement in your application. In this article, we will go through 4 authentication methods and how to implement them in Scala using the Http4s library namely, Basic Authentication, Digest Authentication, Session Authentication, and Token Authentication.

### 1.1 Requirements

To follow along, you will need to add the following to your build.sbt file.

```scala
val scala3Version = "3.2.2"

val Http4sVersion = "0.23.18"
val JwtHttp4sVersion = "1.2.0"
val JwtScalaVersion = "9.3.0"

val http4sDsl =       "org.http4s"              %% "http4s-dsl"          % Http4sVersion
val emberServer =     "org.http4s"              %% "http4s-ember-server" % Http4sVersion
val jwtHttp4s =       "dev.profunktor"          %% "http4s-jwt-auth"     % JwtHttp4sVersion
val jwtScala =        "com.github.jwt-scala"    %% "jwt-core"            % JwtScalaVersion
val jwtCirce =        "com.github.jwt-scala"    %% "jwt-circe"           % JwtScalaVersion

lazy val authentication = project
  .in(file("authentication"))
  .settings(
    name := "authentication",
    version := "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT",
    scalaVersion := scala3Version,
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      emberServer,
      http4sDsl,
      jwtHttp4s,
      jwtScala,
      jwtCirce
    )
  )
```

The code in this article will be written in Scala 3 but can still be implemented for Scala 2 with very minor changes.

## 2. Authentication

Throughout this article, we will be using the different authentication methods to grant a user access to Http4s `Routes`. Here's a simple implementation of how this will be done.

```scala
import cats.effect.*
import org.http4s.*
import org.http4s.dsl.io.*
import org.http4s.server.*
import org.http4s.implicits.*
import org.http4s.ember.server.*
import com.comcast.ip4s.*

object SimpleRoutes extends IOApp {
    val routes: HttpRoutes[IO] =
        HttpRoutes.of {
            case GET -> Root / "welcome" / user =>
                Ok(s"Welcome, ${user}")
        }

    val server = EmberServerBuilder
        .default[IO]
        .withHost(ipv4"0.0.0.0")
        .withPort(port"8080")
        .withHttpApp(routes.orNotFound)
        .build

    override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
       server.use(_ => IO.never).as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```

In this example, the routes are accessed without authentication. We define our routes using the `HttpRoutes.of` function through which `Http4s` pattern matches against each defined `case`. For our implementation, we have one `case` that accepts `GET` requests from `/welcome/user` where the server responds with `Ok(s"Welcome, ${user}")`. `user` is any alphanumeric value that's passed in the request.

We use `Ember` server through port `8080` to receive requests.

For an in-depth explanation of how to use `Http4s`, there's a good explanation of most concepts [here](/http4s-tutorial/).

Let's test our server.

```bash
 curl -vv http://localhost:8080/welcome/john
*   Trying ::1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /welcome/john HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.71.1
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: Wed, 24 May 2023 14:45:11 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
< Content-Length: 13
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Welcome, john⏎
```

When we send a request `http://localhost:8080/welcome/john` to our Rest API, we receive our expected response `Welcome, john`.
At this point we realize anyone can access this route, to limit access to verified users, the solution is authentication.

## 3. Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is an authentication scheme where user credentials are sent through `HTTP` headers to the server for authentication. The specifications for Basic Authentication are defined in [RFC 7617](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617). Here's how it works.

1. The user's credentials are sent to the server through the use of an `Authorization` header with a `Basic` `scheme`.
2. `Basic` authentication requires a `username` and `password` to be sent as credentials to the server
3. The `username` and `password` are joined by a colon `:` and `Base64` encoded before being sent using the `Authorization` header.
4. The `Authorization` header in the request would be defined as `Authorization:Basic Base64(username:password)`
5. When the request is received by the server, the credentials are decoded and used to either grant access to a user with a `200 Ok Success` status code or deny access usually with a `401 Unauthorized` status.

### 3.1 Http4s Implementation

Http4s provides an easy way to implement basic authentication using `Middleware` which is simply a function that takes a service and returns another service.
To begin with we will need a data structure to hold our user information.

```scala
case class User(id: Long, name: String)
```

We will also need a function that intercepts the request to validate the user's credentials before granting access to the routes. This is done by use of a `Kleisli`.

```scala
import cats.data.*
import org.http4s.Credentials
import org.http4s.headers.Authorization

val authUserEither: Kleisli[IO, Request[IO], Either[String, User]] = Kleisli { req =>
    val authHeader: Option[Authorization] = req.headers.get[Authorization]
    authHeader match {
        case Some(value) => value match
            case Authorization(BasicCredentials(creds)) =>  IO(Right(User(1,creds._1)))
            case _ => IO(Left("No basic credentials"))
        case None => IO(Left("Unauthorized"))
    }
}
```

There still a few more steps to make our code work, so keep reading.

We define our Kleisli function `authUserEither` which will take a `Request` and returns an `Either[String,User]`. The function signature `Kleisli[IO, Request[IO], Either[String, User]]` simply translates to `Request[IO] => IO[Either[String, User]]`.

The function checks for the availability of an `Authorization` header which is stored in `authHeader` giving us an `Option[Header]`. Pattern matching on `authHeader` provides us with two cases for the presence or absence of the `Authorization` header.

In case the header is present, we further check for `BasicCredentials` and map those to the `User` case class. The credentials `creds` is a tuple of the form (username,password). At this point in the implementation, one may check against the database to verify the user's credentials, but for simplicity, we return `IO(Right(User(1,creds._1)))` where `creds._1` is the username.
In case we don't receive something other than an `Authorization` header we return a `Left("No basic credentials")` and in case there's no `Authorization` header, we return a `Left("Unauthorized)`.

The next step is to convert our `Kleisli` to middleware by wrapping it in the `AuthMiddleware` function.

```scala
val userMiddleware: AuthMiddleware[IO,User] =
    AuthMiddleware(authUserEither)
```

To use the middleware, we'll need to modify our routes to the `AuthedRoutes` type instead of `HttpRoutes`

```scala
val authedRoutes: AuthedRoutes[User,IO] =
    AuthedRoutes.of {
        case GET -> Root / "welcome" as user =>
            Ok(s"Welcome, ${user.name}")
    }
```

Previously the `user` value was passed as part of the `URI` in the `GET` request, in this case, the `user` value comes in through the `authUserEither` `Kleisli` function. We will also need Routes to handle failure, which we define next.

```scala
val onFailure: AuthedRoutes[String, IO] = Kleisli {(_: AuthedRequest[IO,String]) =>
    OptionT.pure[IO](Response[IO](status = Status.Unauthorized))
}
```

The `onFailure` function takes a request and returns a `Response` with `status` code `401 Unauthorized`. Now we can put everything together using the `AuthMiddleware` function to create the middleware. This function takes `authUserEither` and `onFailure` as arguments.

```scala
val authMiddleware: AuthMiddleware[IO,User] = AuthMiddleware(authUserEither, onFailure)
```

The final is creating our service by passing our `authedRoutes` to the `authMiddleware` function.

```scala
val serviceKleisli: HttpRoutes[IO] = authMiddleware(authedRoutes)
```

With the service now available, we simply pass it to the `Ember` Server and run it.

```scala
val server = EmberServerBuilder
    .default[IO]
    .withHost(ipv4"0.0.0.0")
    .withPort(port"8080")
    .withHttpApp(serviceKleisli.orNotFound)
    .build

override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = server.use(_ => IO.never).as(ExitCode.Success)
```

Let's test our server
First, we encode our username and password in Base64 before we put it in our request.

```bash
$ echo "username:password" | base64
dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQK
```

The encoded value can now be passed to the `Authorization` header with a `Basic` scheme.

```bash
$ curl -v -H "Authorization:Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQK" http://localhost:8080/welcome

*   Trying ::1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /welcome HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.71.1
> Accept: */*
> Authorization:Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQK
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: Sat, 13 May 2023 13:18:09 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
< Content-Length: 17
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Welcome, username⏎
```

We can also run `curl -vv http://localhost:8080/welcome -u username:password` to give use the same result.

Let's test the failure case.

```bash
$ curl -v http://localhost:8080/welcome

*   Trying ::1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /welcome HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.71.1
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
< Date: Sat, 13 May 2023 13:20:14 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< Content-Length: 0
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

Without the `Authorization` header we get a `401 Unauthorized` status. You can change this response by modifying the `onFailure` function.

Here is the full code:

```scala
import cats.data.*
import cats.effect.{IO,IOApp}
import org.http4s.*
import org.http4s.dsl.io.*
import org.http4s.server.*
import org.http4s.implicits.*
import org.http4s.ember.server.*
import com.comcast.ip4s.*
import org.http4s.Credentials
import org.http4s.headers.Authorization

object BasicExample extends IOApp {

  val authUserEither: Kleisli[IO, Request[IO], Either[String, User]] = Kleisli { req =>
      val authHeader: Option[Header] = req.headers.get[Authorization]
      authHeader match {
          case Some(Authorization(BasicCredentials(creds))) => IO(Right(User(1,creds._1)))
          case Some(_) => IO(Left("No basic credentials"))
          case None => IO(Left("Unauthorized"))
      }
  }

  val userMiddleware: AuthMiddleware[IO,User] =
    AuthMiddleware(authUserEither)

  val authedRoutes: AuthedRoutes[User,IO] =
    AuthedRoutes.of {
        case GET -> Root / "welcome" as user =>
            Ok(s"Welcome, ${user.name}")
    }

  val onFailure: AuthedRoutes[String, IO] = Kleisli { _ =>
     OptionT.pure[IO](Response[IO](status = Status.Unauthorized))
  }

  val authMiddleware: AuthMiddleware[IO,User] = AuthMiddleware(authUserEither, onFailure)

  val serviceKleisli: HttpRoutes[IO] = authMiddleware(authedRoutes)

  val server = EmberServerBuilder
    .default[IO]
    .withHost(ipv4"0.0.0.0")
    .withPort(port"8080")
    .withHttpApp(serviceKleisli.orNotFound)
    .build

  override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
     server.use(_ => IO.never).as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```

## 4. Digest Authentication

Similar to Basic Authentication, Digest Authentication also involves passing credentials through the `Authorization` header to the server, however, the Digest Authentication scheme is a two-step process, here's how it works.

1. When a client tries to request information from the server without authorization, the server responds with a `401 Unauthorized` status code, but it also attaches the `realm`, `qop`, and `nounce` to its response.
   The `realm` is a string supplied by the server which sometimes includes the host name.
   `qop` stands for the quality of protection, its value might be `auth` (authentication) or 'auth-int' (authentication with integrity)
   The `nounce` is a unique string generated by the server each time it responds to a `401 status code`.

2. The user at this point provides his or her credentials which are the username and password. These credentials are sent within the `Authorization` header along with some additional information, these include the `realm`, `qop`, and `nounce` which were sent earlier but additionally, the client will attach a `URI`, `cnounce`, `nc` and a `response` to the request.

3. If the credentials checkout, the user will be granted access otherwise access will be denied with the `401 status code`.

I realize there are a lot of new words in the explanation, however, this is beyond the scope of this article, I encourage you to read the [RFC 2617](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2617) specification for Digest Authentication for a more in-depth explanation.

### 4.1 Digest Authentication in http4s

Digest Authentication in Http4s is easily implemented using the `DigestAuth` function, but first, we need to define our `User` case class.

```scala
case class User(id: Long, name: String)
```

The `DigestAuth` function takes two arguments, the `realm` and a function of type `String => IO[Option[(User, String)]]`. This translates to `"username" => IO[Option(User,"password")]`

Let's define this function.

```scala
import cats.effect.*
import org.http4s.server.middleware.authentication.DigestAuth.Md5HashedAuthStore

val ha1: IO[String] = Md5HashedAuthStore.precomputeHash[IO]("username","http://localhost:8080/welcome","password")

val funcPass: String => IO[Option[(User, String)]] = (usr_name: String) =>
    usr_name match {
      case "username" => ha1.flatMap(hash => IO(Some(User(1, "username"), hash)))
      case _ => IO(None)
    }
```

The function `funcPass()` receives the username, which it matches to find the correct `User`. The resulting value `IO[Option[User,String]]` is also checked to contain to correct password. It's important to note that the `funcPass()` function can receive either a plaintext or hashed password.

For this example, we decided to use a hashed password. The Http4s digest middleware will check for an `MD5` hashed password in the form `MD5(username:realm:password)` and matches it against the credentials passed in the request. We use the `Md5HashedAuthStore.precomputeHash[IO]()` function to create our hashed value, it takes the `username`, `realm`, and `password` as arguments and returns an `IO[String]`.

```scala
import org.http4s.server.*
import org.http4s.server.middleware.authentication.DigestAuth

   val middleware: IO[AuthMiddleware[IO, User]] =
      DigestAuth.applyF[IO,User]("http://localhost:8080/welcome", Md5HashedAuthStore(funcPass))
```

To create our `middleware` we use the `.applyF` method on the `DigestAuth` object which takes a `realm` of type `String` and a `store` of type `AuthStore[F, A]`. For our example, we passed the realm as `http://localhost:8080/welcome` and `store` as `Md5HashedAuthStore(funcPass)`.

In case you want to supply a plaintext password, use `PlainTextAuthStore(funcPass)` as your argument, this is imported as follows, `import org.http4s.server.middleware.authentication.DigestAuth.PlainTextAuthStore`.

Your choice of `store` determines how the `username` and `password` will be validated.

Just like Basic Authentication, we'll also need `AuthedRoutes`.

```scala
import org.http4s.*
import org.http4s.dsl.io.*

val authedRoutes: AuthedRoutes[User,IO] =
    AuthedRoutes.of {
        case GET -> Root / "welcome" as user =>
            Ok(s"Welcome, ${user.name}")
    }
```

To create our service, we call our routes through our `AuthMiddleware[IO, User]()` (middleware) function defined previously.

```scala
val digestService: IO[HttpRoutes[IO]] =
    middleware.map(wrapper => wrapper(authedRoutes))
```

Because `AuthMiddleware[IO, User]` is wrapped in an `IO` we need to call `map` on `middleware` to use it. This gives us a service (`digestService`) of type `HttpRoutes[IO]` also wrapped in an `IO`.

Finally, we pass our service to the Ember server and run it.

```scala
import org.http4s.ember.server.*
import com.comcast.ip4s.*

def server(service: IO[HttpRoutes[IO]]): IO[Resource[cats.effect.IO, Server]] =
    service.map { svc =>
        EmberServerBuilder
            .default[IO]
            .withHost(ipv4"0.0.0.0")
            .withPort(port"8080")
            .withHttpApp(svc.orNotFound)
            .build
    }

 override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = server(digestService).flatMap(s => s.use(_ => IO.never)).as(ExitCode.Success)
```

Here we define a function `server()` which pulls our service out of the `IO` and passes it to the `EmberServiceBuilder`'s `.withHttpApp()` method. This returns our server `Resource` of type `IO[Resource[IO, Server]]` also wrapped in an `IO`.

To run our server we need to call `flatMap` on `server(digestService)` then call `.use(_ => IO.never)` on `Resource[cats.effect.IO, Server]`, and finally end with `ExitCode.Success`.

We can now test our server.

```bash
curl -vv http://localhost:8080/welcome --digest -u username:password
*   Trying ::1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
* Server auth using Digest with user 'username'
> GET /welcome HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.71.1
> Accept: */*
>

<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Welcome, username⏎
```

`curl` provides a `--digest` flag which takes the username and password and does the initial request followed by a second request with credentials attached in one step.

If the wrong password or username is provided, the server will respond with a `401 Unauthorized`, its also important to note that if the Authorization header is missing or the scheme is anything but `Digest`, the request will fail with a `401 Unauthorized` as well.

Here's the full code:

```scala
import cats.effect.*
import org.http4s.*
import org.http4s.dsl.io.*
import org.http4s.server.*
import org.http4s.ember.server.*
import com.comcast.ip4s.*
import org.http4s.server.middleware.authentication.DigestAuth
import org.http4s.server.middleware.authentication.DigestAuth.Md5HashedAuthStore

object DigestExample extends IOApp {
    case class User(id: Long, name: String)

    val ha1: IO[String] = Md5HashedAuthStore.precomputeHash[IO]("username","http://localhost:8080/welcome","password")
    val funcPass: String => IO[Option[(User, String)]] = (usr_name: String) =>
        usr_name match {
          case "username" => ha1.flatMap(hash => IO(Some(User(1, "username"), hash)))
          case _ => IO(None)
        }

    val middleware: IO[AuthMiddleware[IO, User]] =
       DigestAuth.applyF[IO,User]("http://localhost:8080/welcome", Md5HashedAuthStore(funcPass))

    val authedRoutes: AuthedRoutes[User,IO] =
        AuthedRoutes.of {
            case GET -> Root / "welcome" as user =>
                Ok(s"Welcome, ${user.name}")
        }

    val digestService: IO[HttpRoutes[IO]] =
        middleware.map(wrapper => wrapper(authedRoutes))

    def server(service: IO[HttpRoutes[IO]]): IO[Resource[IO, Server]] =
        service.map { svc =>
            EmberServerBuilder
                .default[IO]
                .withHost(ipv4"0.0.0.0")
                .withPort(port"8080")
                .withHttpApp(svc.orNotFound)
                .build
        }

    override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
       server(digestService).flatMap(s => s.use(_ => IO.never)).as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```

## 5. Session Authentication

Session authentication is an authentication technique where the server keeps track of session information after the user has logged in. It works in the following way.

1. When a user logs into a website after verification of username and password, the server responds with a generated unique string which is passed in the `Response` and set as a cookie on the client's side.
2. This unique string is always passed whenever there are subsequent requests made by the client. If the unique string is valid, access is granted otherwise access is denied.
3. This cookie can also be valid for a specific amount of time, after which it expires and is automatically removed on the client side.
4. If the client logs out, the server will remove the cookie from the client side as well.

### 5.1 Session Authentication in Http4s

For this implementation, we are going to reuse our code from the Digest Authentication section. We're going to illustrate this technique with an easy cipher &mdash; which should otherwise not be used in production &mdash; for you to understand the mechanics.

The first thing we need is a way to generate the unique code that we will send to the client.

```scala
import java.time.LocalDateTime
import java.util.Base64
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets

val today: String = LocalDateTime.now().toString()
def setToken(user: String, date: String):String =
   Base64.getEncoder.encodeToString(s"${user}:{$today}".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
```

> NOTE: do not use this exact encoding in production!
> This example is for illustration to ease understanding. Base64 is easily deciphered, and an attacker can easily impersonate someone by knowing their username and a rough time when the server was started.
> For true security, such tokens should be signed by a private key. Look [here](https://http4s.org/v1/docs/auth.html#cookies) for more info.

Here we create the unique code or token using the `setToken` function which takes a username as `user` and a date computed by `LocalDateTime.now().toString()`, these values are then combined and encoded using Java's `Base64` utility.

Next, we attach a new cookie to the response, this happens after a successful login.

We'll also define a function that will decode the token when it's received from the client.

```scala
import scala.util.*

def getUser(token: String): Try[String] = Try((new String(Base64.getDecoder.decode(token))).split(":")(0))
```

The `getUser` function will take the token and try to decode it, this can either succeed or fail as we will see later.

We modify the `authedRoutes` from our Digest authentication example to add a cookie with the token information

```scala
import cats.effect.*
import org.http4s.*
import org.http4s.dsl.io.*

case class User(id: Long, name: String)
val authedRoutes: AuthedRoutes[User,IO] =
    AuthedRoutes.of {
        case GET -> Root / "welcome" as user =>
            Ok(s"Welcome, ${user.name}").map(_.addCookie(ResponseCookie("sessioncookie", setToken(user.name, today), maxAge = Some(86400))))
    }
```

We set our session token as a cookie on the client side using the `addCookie` function on the `Response` object. The `ResponseCookie` object takes the cookie name, `sessioncookie`, the cookie value which we set using the `setToken` function which we call with the user name and the current datetime, and finally, the maxAge, which is how long the token will persist. This is set to `Some(86400)` equal to 24 hours.

Separate routes are also defined that will be accessed using our session data.

```scala
val cookieAccessRoutes = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "statement" =>
    Ok("Financial statement processing...")
  case GET -> Root / "logout" =>
    Ok("Logging out...").map(_.removeCookie("sessioncookie"))
}
```

The `cookieAccessRoutes` service contains two routes, `/statement` which returns financial statement information, and `/logout` which removes the `sessioncookie` token when the user is logging out. It uses the `removeCookie` function on the `Response` object.

We can now define our session authentication service.

```scala
import cats.data.*
import org.http4s.headers.Cookie

def checkSessionCookie(cookie: Cookie):Option[RequestCookie] =
    cookie.values.toList.find(_.name == "sessioncookie")

def modifyPath(user: String):Path =
    Uri.Path.fromString(s"/statement/$user")

def cookieCheckerService(service: HttpRoutes[IO]): HttpRoutes[IO] = Kleisli { req =>
    val authHeader: Option[Cookie] = req.headers.get[Cookie]
    OptionT.liftF(authHeader.fold(Ok("No cookies")) { cookie =>
        checkSessionCookie(cookie).fold(Ok("No token")) { token =>
            getUser(token.content).fold(
                _ => Ok("Invalid token"),
                user => service.orNotFound.run(req.withPathInfo(modifyPath(user)))
             )
        }
    })
}
```

In http4s one can define custom middleware through the use of a `Kleisli`, here we define a function `cookieCheckerService()` that takes a service of type `HttpRoutes[IO]` and returns another service. This Kleisli contains three helper functions, `checkSessionCookie()`, `getUser()`, and `modifyPath()` which we will break down in the following section.

The `cookieCheckerService()` function will intercept the request and check if it contains any cookies, this is done using the `.get[Cookie]` function on the request headers, which returns an `Option[Cookie]`. When we call `fold` on `authHeader`, we handle the absence of cookies by responding with `Ok("No cookies)` otherwise if cookies are present we check for our `sessioncookie`.

The `checkSessionCookie()` function is then called to check for the presence of the `sessioncookie` within the list of cookies sent through the request, this is done by running `cookie.values.toList.find(_.name == "sessioncookie")` and returns an `Option[RequestCookie]`.

When we call `fold` on the `checkSessionCookie(cookie)` we handle the absence of the `sessioncookie` by returning `Ok("No token")`, otherwise we retrieve the user name by calling `getUser(token.content)`. `token.content` is the token string passed within the `sessioncookie` cookie. `getUser()` returns a Try[String].

If the `getUser()` function fails, we return `Ok("Invalid token")`, otherwise we return a `service` of type `HttpRoutes[IO]` with a modified path. The `.withPathInfo()` method on our request object takes a new `Path` object to which it will forward the request. The `modifyPath()` function takes our user as an argument and returns a new path, `s"/statement/$user"` with the user name inserted. This is done by calling `Uri.Path.fromString(s"/statement/$user")`.

Let's define a router to handle our two services.

```scala
import org.http4s.server.*

val serviceRouter =
    Router(
        "/login" -> digestService,
        "/" -> cookieCheckerService(cookieAccessRoutes)
    )
```

The `/login` path will receive our login request which will be handled by digestService while the sessions will be handled by the `cookieCheckerService()` function taking the `cookieAccessRoutes` service as an argument.

Finally, we can run our server with our new serviceRouter.

```scala
import org.http4s.ember.server.*
import com.comcast.ip4s.*

val server = EmberServerBuilder
  .default[IO]
  .withHost(ipv4"0.0.0.0")
  .withPort(port"8080")
  .withHttpApp(serviceRouter.orNotFound)
  .build

override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = server.use(_ => IO.never).as(ExitCode.Success)
```

Let's test our service, first by logging in.

```bash
curl -vv http://localhost:8080/login/welcome --digest -u username:password
*   Trying ::1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)

```

The sessioncookie has now been sent to the client and can be used for subsequent requests.

```bash
curl -vv --cookie "sessioncookie=dXNlcm5hbWU6ezIwMjMtMDUtMjJUMTM6Mjk6MTEuMzc5NTI4fQ==" http://localhost:8080/statement

## 6. JSON Web Token Authentication

For JWT authentication to work, a payload containing information for authentication is transmitted between the client and service as a JSON object. JSON Web Tokens are digitally signed using a secret or a private/public key pair so that the tokens' integrity can be verified by both the server and the client.

### 6.1 JWT authentication in http4s

We'll be using the `http4s-jwt-auth` library to implement JWT's in Http4s.
First, let's create our token that we will send to the client once he/she logs in.

```scala
import pdi.jwt.*
import java.time.Instant

val claim = JwtClaim(content = """{"user":"John", "level":"basic"}""", expiration =
   Some(Instant.now.plusSeconds(157784760).getEpochSecond), issuedAt = Some(Instant.now.getEpochSecond))

val key = "secretKey"

val algo = JwtAlgorithm.HS256

val token = JwtCirce.encode(claim, key, algo)
```

To create our token we use the `encode` function from `JwtCirce`, which takes a `secret key`, the encoding algorithm, `JwtAlgorithm.HS256`, and a `claim` passed as a `JwtClaim` object.
The `JwtClaim` object contains the payload which is stored as a JSON string, `"""{"user":"John", "level":"basic"}"""`, here we include the `user` name and his access `level`, there also `expiration` and `issuedAt` values which are both of type `Option[Long]`.

Now we can define our login route where we pass our JSON Web Token to the client.

```scala
import cats.effect.*
import org.http4s.*
import org.http4s.dsl.io.*

val loginRoutes: HttpRoutes[IO] =
    HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
        case GET -> Root / "login" =>
            Ok(s"Logged In").map(_.addCookie(ResponseCookie("token", token)))
    }
```

In this case, the JSON Web Token is stored as a cookie named `token` on the client side.

When a request is received we will need to handle the JSON stored in the payload.

```scala
import io.circe.*

case class TokenPayLoad(user: String, level: String)

object TokenPayLoad {
    given decoder: Decoder[TokenPayLoad] = Decoder.instance { h =>
        for {
            user <- h.get[String]("user")
            level <- h.get[String]("level")
        } yield TokenPayLoad(user,level)
    }
}
```

We can parse the JSON string with the help of `Circe`, first we define a case class named `TokenPayLoad` which will hold our payload information. The companion object `TokenPayLoad` contains a `given` or `implicit` decoder method that `yields` a `Decoder[TokenPayLoad]` object from the JSON string.
Now we can define a function to authenticate the JSON Web Token when it's passed by the user.

```scala
import dev.profunktor.auth.jwt.*
import io.circe.parser.*

case class AuthUser(id: Long, name: String)
val database = Map("John" -> AuthUser(123,"JohnDoe"))

val authenticate: JwtToken => JwtClaim => IO[Option[AuthUser]] =
    (token: JwtToken) =>
        (claim: JwtClaim)
        => decode[TokenPayLoad](claim.content) match {
                case Right(payload) =>
                    IO(database.get(payload.user))
                case Left(_) => IO(None)
        }
```

The `authenticate` function signature is of type `JwtToken => JwtClaim => IO[Option[AuthUser]]`. This function receives a `JwtToken` and transforms it into a `JWTClaim`, the payload represented as `claim.content` is then extracted and passed to our decoder function. This function results in an `Either[circe.error, TokenPayLoad]`, we can then pattern match against this value to check if the user exists in our simple database by calling `database.get(payload.user)` and returning either a `Left` with circe.error or `Right` with the `TokenPayLoad`. The final result will be an `IO[Option[AuthUser]]`.

We can now define the middleware and routes.

```scala
import dev.profunktor.auth.*

val jwtAuth = JwtAuth.hmac(key, algo)
val middleware = JwtAuthMiddleware[IO, AuthUser](jwtAuth, authenticate)

val authedRoutes: AuthedRoutes[AuthUser,IO] =
AuthedRoutes.of {
    case GET -> Root / "welcome" as user =>
        Ok(s"Welcome, ${user.name}")
}
```

The middleware is defined by calling `JwtAuthMiddleware[IO, AuthUser](jwtAuth, authenticate)`. It takes the `authenticate` function and a `JwtAuth` object which holds the `key` and `algo` values.

The signature for `middleware` is `Kleisli[[_] =>> cats.data.OptionT[cats.effect.IO, _], ContextRequest[cats.effect.IO, AuthUser], Response[cats.effect.IO]] => Kleisli[[_] =>> cats.data.OptionT[cats.effect.IO, _], Request[cats.effect.IO], Response[cats.effect.IO]]`. This seems daunting but it's important to remember, middleware in Http4s is a service that returns another service.

In our case, this `Kleisli` receives the request, authenticates our `token` then forwards the request to `authRoutes` which is the second service that matches against the routes and returns a `Response`.

```scala
import cats.implicits.*

val securedRoutes: HttpRoutes[IO] = middleware(authedRoutes)

val service = loginRoutes <+> securedRoutes
```

`securedRoutes` is now our authentication service created by calling `middleware(authedRoutes)` and returns an `HttpRoutes[IO]`.
We then compose `service` using the `<+>` operator. `service` now gives us access to both `loginRoutes` and `securedRoutes`.

Finally, we can run our server.

```scala
import org.http4s.ember.server.*
import com.comcast.ip4s.*

val server = EmberServerBuilder
   .default[IO]
   .withHost(ipv4"0.0.0.0")
   .withPort(port"8080")
   .withHttpApp(service.orNotFound)
   .build

override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =
   server.use(_ => IO.never).as(ExitCode.Success)
```

Let's test our server.

```bash
curl -vv http://localhost:8080/login
*   Trying ::1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /login HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080

<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact

```

First, we log into the server and receive the JSON Web Token, then we can be connected to the rest of the site as an authorized user.

```bash
curl -vv -H "Authorization:Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE4NDI1NDU2NjQsImlhdCI6MTY4NDc2MDkwNCwidXNlciI6IkpvaG4iLCAibGV2ZWwiOiJiYXNpYyJ9.VjkUrL6Ud0SINNWhUV8M_fFi9YgU8zxevcasiosRIKg" http://localhost:8080/welcome

<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Welcome, JohnDoe⏎
```

We receive the expected welcome message `Welcome, JohnDoe⏎ `, note that the JWT token is passed as a `Bearer` token using the `Authorization` header.

In case we receive a wrong token, the server will respond with a `403 Forbidden` status code and an `Invalid access token` message.

In case we receive a request without the `Authorization:Bearer` header or anything other than this specific header, the server will respond with a `403 Forbidden` status code and a `Bearer token not found` message.

```

## 7. Conclusion

This article taught us four different ways of implementing HTTP authentication in Scala using Http4s, these include Basic, Digest, Session, and Token authentication methods. We discovered common techniques used and the important role middleware plays when carrying our authentication in Http4s. This article mainly focused on implementation, I would encourage you to read more about the pros and cons of each authentication method to get more context for your application needs.
