My team is expanding the use of Akka in our products so I needed a quick introduction on this topic. I have tried a couple of courses but the introduction to Akka was always too abrupt, too hard to comprehend. I blamed Akka for this as being too hard to explain. This was until I was exposed to the Rock The JVM courses which were an absolute delight when it comes to **presenting such complex topics in such an easy to understand way**. And Daniel has not stopped at Akka but has added to his portfolio amazing courses on Scala and Spark too. It seems like he is quite enjoying taking such challenges like complex technologies and making them so simple for everyone. I have instantly recommended Daniel's work to my team, which helped them immensely with taking their skills to a new level, and I do recommend these courses to anyone who wants to have the fastest ramp-up in these tough but popular technologies.
