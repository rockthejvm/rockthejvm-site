From Scala, to Akka, to Spark, Daniel delivers exceptional material in each and every one of these technologies. I've been using them for a long time and there is always something new I will discover from him. **The level of detail he gets into as well as the way he delivers material is mindblowing**. I personally find his latest course Spark Optimization pure gold and one of a kind. I've been using Spark for a year now and I haven't even thought how much you can leverage query plans to make such optimizations. **I can't stop thinking every time, how he manages to go so deep** - because using a technology is one thing, but knowing its internals so well and how everything works behind the scenes is another story when it comes to distributed systems. Long story short Daniel is definitely the best instructor I've come across and each one of his courses is the best resource you can find online. Kudos for all your work and knowledge sharing.
