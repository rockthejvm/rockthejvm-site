Daniel's courses on Scala and Big Data are the best in class. I've been in touch with Daniel's teaching and courses since early 2018. The first course that I took from him was Scala & Functional Programming; I was skeptical about it because over the internet there are many courses you can find, but few really worthy. I remember the very first day when Daniel started to speak and shared his examples - I started to love Scala, and then more as we went on. I am with Scala for the last 5 years now, but never ever has anyone explained to me or gave me comparable resources to Rock the JVM. Daniel gave me a shift in life and **helped me crack top tech company interviews**. His courses on big data are a must for any aspiring big data developer or data enthusiast. I highly recommend Daniel as an educator both online and on campus.
