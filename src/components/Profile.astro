      <p>
        I'm a software engineer and the founder of Rock the JVM. I started the
        Rock the JVM project out of love for Scala and the technologies it
        powers - they are all amazing tools and I want to share as much of my
        experience with them as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of February 2024, I've taught Java, Scala, Kotlin and related tech
        (e.g. Cats, ZIO, Spark) to 100000+ students at various levels and I've
        held live training sessions for some of the best companies in the
        industry, including Adobe and Apple. I've also taught university
        students who now work at Google and Facebook (among others), I've held
        Hour of Code for 7-year-olds and I've taught more than 35000 kids to
        code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science and I wrote my Bachelor and
        Master theses on Quantum Computation. Before starting to learn
        programming, I won medals at international Physics competitions.
